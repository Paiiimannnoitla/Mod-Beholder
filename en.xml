  <string id="3595">Voice of Truth</string>
  <string id="905">Theatre scandal</string>
  <string id="906">The first evening performance of the capital play "On Love and Peace" resulted in a scandal. Part of the audience left before the end. "Plays should portray real people, not silly stories that have nothing to do with reality," said Bruno Raus, head of plant No. 1's recreation department. The theatre administration promised to shut down the play and ensure future plays don't upset the workers.</string>
  <string id="4855">Once every three years, great actors come to our nowheresville and receive a cold welcome! "On Love and Peace," the latest play to premiere at our local theatre, was shut down when raging miners refused to watch the love story. It's hard to blame them. There's no place for feelings in the life of a common laborer; just work, quarrels, and grocery store lines. But comrades! Let's not allow our slavery to take away our aesthetic sensitivity! Go to the theatre!</string>
  <string id="4856">Who will work, then? The country needs our labor, not shows!</string>
  <string id="4857">Dead Words</string>
  <string id="8215">The Ministry of Truth has noticed a rising interest in philosophy books, including the works of Paul Williams, who died a century ago. His writings describe obsolete ideas that have been proven to be unrealistic; however, they still capture people's minds. The Ministry believes the notion of a society without government, in which the freedom of personal choice exists, is dangerous and should be destroyed in all its forms.</string>
  <string id="8216">The fact that our society is capable of understanding Paul Williams' ideas en mass proves his unique talent and ability to word things simply. We should encourage interest in the great thinkers of the past if we want to progress and initiate a dialogue between the people and the State.</string>
  <string id="8217">Philosophy is nonsense.</string>
  <string id="8218">Death by Needle</string>
  <string id="8219">The son of the miners' trade union leader was found unconscious after criminals reportedly pumped him full of drugs. He's being treated and rehabilitated at the hospital. The Ministry of Order advises citizens to be alert and interfere with any attempts to manufacture and spread drugs. Remember: your child could be next!</string>
  <string id="8220">Drugs are a huge problem in our society. We should've started dealing with them a long time ago, not wait for a VIP to get in trouble. By the way, this isn't the first time the well-known son has been at the center of a scandal. Was he really a victim?</string>
  <string id="8221">The Right Path</string>
  <string id="8222">We are aware of the complaints our citizens are making about the public transportation system. The deputy head of the Ministry of Transportation said, "Public transportation is one of the most important factors impacting the efficiency of our labor. And the performance of every Ministry employee is satisfactory." He also said senseless and groundless complaints waste valuable time that could be spent working, and will be considered sabotage in the future.</string>
  <string id="8223">It's widely known that the state department is swarming with officials, and that the bureaucracy has become so cumbersome, it can't function. Besides, the city buses are dozens of years old, and the drivers haven't been given a raise in all that time. It's impossible to go anywhere quickly when riding an ancient rig driven by a starving old man.</string>
  <string id="8224">Poor guys! I should give them one of the grandma's pies tomorrow.</string>
  <string id="8225">Water Tragedy</string>
  <string id="8226">A tragic incident took place yesterday near Port Shier. The Goliath, which was carrying a load of coal for export, was set on fire and sank. By the time the Coast Guard found the barge, there was no one left to save. Those who escaped the flames must have drowned or been attacked by sharks. Allegedly, the vessel was also carrying 10-15 unregistered passengers. An investigation is being carried out, and a vacancy for a barge has opened on that route.</string>
  <string id="8227">Our condolences to those who lost family members in the barge accident. It's unfortunate our fleet is in such terrible condition and isn't safe to use. It's even sadder that, despite this, people are still trying to escape the country due to the deteriorating quality of life. We advise you to not fall victim to the scammers promising paradise abroad; more often than not, our well-being is the last thing that matters to them. This can lead to tragedy.</string>
  <string id="8228">Law Enforcement</string>
  <string id="8229">Yesterday was marked with a small but important triumph of justice. Police arrested Klaus Schimmer as he tried to sneak into temporary confinement, where his wife was being held. Mrs. Schimmer was detained on the suspicion of violating state directives. He was shot as a threat to civil safety and a traitor. Let this serve as an example to everyone: the police safeguard our great State, and anyone threatening them will be exterminated.</string>
  <string id="8230">Yet another case of police brutality took place yesterday. Comrade Schimmer was shot without due process outside a police station, where he'd come to inquire about his wife's condition after being denied contact with her following her arrest. The police are no longer law enforcement intended to protect us; they are a tool for threatening the people. Their new role has backfired on them, though, because they've lost the trust and respect of the people, which has resulted in increased criminal activity. Of course, the State doesn't care; even someone who's simply concerned about his or her spouse is a criminal in the eyes of our leaders.</string>
  <string id="8231">He shouldn't have attacked the police! Was he stupid?</string>
  <string id="8232">Food Poisoning</string>
  <string id="8233">An unfortunate gastronomical incident took place yesterday in coal mine no. 29. Following lunch at the local dining hall, an entire shift of workers came down with food poisoning. The exact reason is unknown, although all of them ate the fish soup. Investigators have established that Rosa Ranek, the cook, was in charge of preparing and serving the soup, and they are questioning her. We should also note the iron will of the workers, who, despite great pains and a terrible fever, returned to work, realizing how much the State needs them in this time of war.</string>
  <string id="8234">State officials are once again trying to turn someone into a scapegoat for something that's their fault! The cook simply couldn't make soup that would poison people; it's more rational to suggest the products were rotten to begin with, and were probably bought that way because they were cheaper. Worst of all, the sick miners had return to work, not out of loyalty, but out of fear of being fired!</string>
  <string id="8235">Cooks should eat what they make to avoid things like that!</string>
  <string id="8236">One Nation, One Language</string>
  <string id="8237">The Ministry of Care would like everyone to use the national language. We are one nation, and should speak one language," the Minister said. Ministry officials say these measures will increase public safety, making our country less vulnerable to spies and turncoats. The latter include everyone who stores foreign literature and speaks a foreign language.</string>
  <string id="8238">Overcome by another fit of paranoia, the Ministry of Order now considers every foreigner and foreign culture enthusiast a spy, including those who are here legally. With such an approach, all we'll be good for is selling coal! How can we deal with neighboring countries if we can't talk with them?</string>
  <string id="8239">Why shouldn't we require them to speak our language?</string>
  <string id="8240">Duck Invasion</string>
  <string id="8241">An outrage occurred last night at the city port! Two unknown individuals unloaded several truckloads of rubber ducks into the water near the port. Witnesses say the trucks were marked Duck Fleet." The ducklings, which drifted for miles on the current, bore inscriptions such as "Make ducks, not mines," "Ducks want peace," and "This war is a lame duck." The Minister of Order said this was a planned attack aimed at lowering the morale of our military; therefore, those responsible will be found and prosecuted. He also said rubber ducks are now considered anti-state propaganda, and storing them will be grounds for a fine.</string>
  <string id="8242">The editorial staff says the article was an attempt to kill the editor-in-chief, who nearly died laughing, and refuses to comment on the rubber duck ban.</string>
  <string id="8243">Ducks are serious business!</string>

  <string id="9679">Breaking news!</string>
  <string id="9680">Several hours ago, a series of explosions took place at the convenience goods storage facility on Krushvice Street. No one was killed but 15 people were injured. The situation is under control, so there's no reason to panic. Now for the weather: Tomorrow, look for winds from the north, a high of 60 degrees, and light showers.</string>
  <string id="9681">Comrades! We have spoken - and spoken loud! The whole city heard! The explosions took place at the plant where State officials were planning to introduce 14-hour shifts!

  <string id="9683">Last night, criminals boldly robbed the west branch of the Central Bank. The police neutralized them before they escaped and are working to establish their identities. Several factory workers and an underage miner are reportedly among them.</string>
  <string id="9684">Comrades! The government has turned our workers into criminals! Poverty ruins young lives, then they die on the steps of the Central Bank with bullets in their chests! They died so we could keep fighting!</string>

  <string id="9688">Today is a day of grief. Professor Gorchik was first defamed and then executed along with his wife and oldest daughter! Gorchik, Jr., who just turned nine, was sent to the labor camp! Let's honor their memory with a minute of silence.</string>

  <string id="13123">Professor Pepper, who is infamous for committing bribery and other dirty deeds, has finally done something useful. Namely, he admitted to impeding the education of our young people instead of promoting it! Shame on the person that sends our students to war!</string>
  <string id="13124">What were the doctors doing in the university?</string>
  <string id="13125">Voice of the State</string>
  <string id="13126">Starting today, the streets of Helmer are decorated with mobile propaganda units. Each one will be transmitting patriotic stations non-stop! Citizens will now be able to listen to the last news around the clock and resist the propaganda of the enemy!</string>
  <string id="13127">Any normal person wants to relax quietly with a book, a TV show, or family after work! But the non-stop propaganda is torture!</string>
  <string id="13128">University Closed</string>
  <string id="13129">Due to the recent events at the university, the Ministry of Order has closed the facility. All of employees have been laid off, some of the students will be assigned to the labor camps, and others will be sent to war.</string>
  <string id="13130">Comrades, we mourn that horrific decision!</string>
  <string id="13131">There you go, idiots! Since you didn't want to study, you get to march!</string>
  <string id="13132">Rest for Workers</string>
  <string id="13133">The employees of mine 17 held a meeting about improving the conditions of their work environment. They decided everything is fine and signed up for a vacation. Local resorts offer a wide range of vacation and educational programs, including museum tours, visiting memorials to our Dear Leader, and attending patriotic seminars.</string>
  <string id="13134">Being on vacation is worse than working! The workers were there to rally for improved conditions in the mines!</string>
  <string id="13135">Mine on Fire</string>
  <string id="13136">The employees of mine 17 are on strike. Officials have closed the mine and fired the workers. Those injured during the demonstrations were rushed to Hospital PTDC 4. In cultural news, on Dec. 21, every House of Culture will hold a celebratory concert dedicated to our Dear Leader's birthday. The ministry is currently accepting applications for amateur performances.</string>
  <string id="13137">A mine burned down, hundreds were injured, and all they care about is the DL's birthday! We see through them! They're afraid to tell us the real news!</string>
  <string id="13138">Poor miners. A toast to the DL on the 21st!</string>
  <string id="13139">A War Hero Dies</string>
  <string id="13140">Gen. Airel Johnson, a famous war hero, has tragically died! The entire country is taking part in three days of mourning! The general was shot at the Central Stadium while giving schoolkids a lecture about the importance of the army. The general is dead, but his work goes on!</string>
  <string id="13141">Aglow Butcher kicks the bucket! Hooray! No more sending our youth to the frontline instead of school!</string>
  <string id="13142">Life is Great</string>
  <string id="13143">Leo Gvizdek is the winner of the Annual Labor Lottery! He has faithfully served his country for 20 years without a single violation! He is the pride of the state! The prize this year is $100,000! Remember: every citizen with more than 15 years of work experience can take part in the lottery.</string>
  <string id="13144">People with more than 15 years of work experience can take part in the lottery. What does that tell us? That Leo and his companions in misfortune spent decades working hard and paying crazy amounts of money to the labor lottery fund. Each of them could've saved $40,000 over the course of 20 years! Where did the rest of that money go? Can the lottery administration tell us that?</string>
  <string id="13145">Neighbor News</string>
  <string id="13146">Our neighbor, North Borea, is celebrating today! They have exceeded their general production plan by 40 percent! Congratulations, comrades! You are leading by example! The Ministry of Development reports our country is ahead of our plan, too, as wheat was harvested a full month before it was due!</string>
  <string id="13147">Why don't you also tell us that every third person in North Borea is working in a labor camp? And that their money has long been replaced by tallies? And that 250 people were executed for not bowing when their leader mounted the platform! It's pure slavery!</string>
  <string id="13148">Gardens for Work!</string>
  <string id="13149">The internal investigation of the case of the Ministry gardens is over. We are happy to report that every garden belongs to the Ministry of Households, and is not private property. The gardens are being used exclusively for state affairs and agricultural activities.</string>
  <string id="13150">Everyone knows what they're doing! Who doubted that this would be the result of their fake "investigation?"</string>
  <string id="13151">Incidents</string>
  <string id="13152">The crime rate in the city continues to decline! The following was reported in Helmer during the last 24 hours: no assaults; no thefts; and just one domestic homicide. The victim was Dora Noel. The main suspect is her husband, Bruno Noel.</string>
  <string id="13153">If there are no criminals, who's occupying our jails? We'll tell you – anyone who opposes the government! We demand that the prison gates be opened and the innocent be set free! Freedom for all!</string>
  <string id="13154">This is crazy! What else do you want? For the dead to be resurrected?</string>
  <string id="13155">Gen. Airel Johnson, a famous war hero, has tragically died! The entire country is taking part in three days of mourning! The general accidentally ingested poison instead of his medication. He might be dead, but his work goes on!</string>
  <string id="13156">General Airel Johnson, a famous war hero, has tragically died! The entire country is taking part in three days of mourning! The general was stabbed to death near his residence as he was preparing to give a series of lectures in our city. He might be dead, but his work goes on!</string>
  <string id="13157">To Arms!</string>
  <string id="13159">Gen. Airel Johnson's lecture at the Central Stadium was a huge success! The famous war hero told a huge gathering of schoolkids about the importance of a patriotic upbringing and volunteering for the army! Over 3,000 young patriots answered his call!</string>
  <string id="13173">Fatal prize</string>
  <string id="13174">A lottery win has turned into a tragic loss! A fair citizen, Leo Gvizdek, won the prize and was taking the money to a bank when ne'er do wells emerged from a dark alley, attacked and killed comrade Gvizdek, and stole the money. An investigation is underway. Eyewitnesses say they heard the assailants screaming something about jellied meat.</string>
  <string id="13175">Poor worker... Comrades, nothing good can come from the government! In a poor country, only the criminals are prospering! And honest people like us are afraid to let their children leave the house! We demand that every dark alley be brightly lit so the criminal element can't hide in the shadows!</string>
  <string id="13169">The butcher from Agloe continues his dark work! His beautiful speeches hide a terrible call to send students to war! Why does no one hear the truth?</string>
  <string id="13170">After the show, the group of unknown persons tried to organize a disturbance, but our valiant police force brought a quick end to their efforts.</string>

  <string id="7998">I agree to meet your doctor. Give him my number and the secret word...</string>
  <string id="7999">It's Clara. You called me a couple of hours ago.</string>
  <string id="8001">I'll be waiting for his call.</string>
  <string id="8003">Did you write it down?</string>
  <string id="8635">Hello, Carl?</string>
  <string id="10101">Strawberries with cream</string>
  <string id="10863">Comrade Carl, we have proof that your son took part in putting up the anti-government posters in your building. We recommend you admit he did it and turn him in.</string>
  <string id="10865">You made the right choice, Carl. In light of your admission, we're going to transfer your son to the Department of Corrections.</string>
  <string id="10867">Then provide us with any other culprit within 24 hours or you're fired!</string>
  <string id="10873">Comrade Carl, there is anti-government propaganda in your building!</string>
  <string id="10874">Good news, Carl. Patrick is coming home!</string>
  <string id="10875">You're wrong! My son is no rebel!</string>
  <string id="10877">Our new technology set him straight.</string>
  <string id="10880">Okay. But promise me you won't kill him!</string>
  <string id="10884">He won't be punished...severely.</string>
  <string id="10886">You're making a big mistake, Carl…</string>
  <string id="10897">AGREE</string>
  <string id="10898">REFUSE</string>
  <string id="10892">Remove at once!</string>
  <string id="11307">We've heard Inga Birkenfeld died. We know it was an accident, but that doesn't mean you can neglect your duty.</string>
  <string id="11317">We need to know more about our citizens to prevent such occurrences.</string>
  <string id="11315">Therefore, provide five tenant characteristics ASAP.</string>
  <string id="11305">Examine the building and talk with your tenants immediately. DO NOT mention the current danger; we don't want to spark a panic.</string>
  <string id="11325">Carl, there's a code orange alarm in the city!</string>
  <string id="11320">You might have an explosive device in your building!</string>
  <string id="11311">Carl, what happened to Inga Birkenfeld? How could she leave the country?</string>
  <string id="11316">That was a rhetorical question. Your tenants are your responsibility.</string>
  <string id="11326">One more incident like that, and you'll end up in jail.</string>
  <string id="11323">She was supposed to do her job! You are therefore fined.</string>
  <string id="11937">LAD?</string>
  <string id="11909">If you commit more than the acceptable number of violations, you will be laid off.</string>
  <string id="11910">You must go to the Experimental Cloning Center for standardization.</string>
  <string id="11911">In five days, an investigator will arrive at your building to pick up your notes and documents.</string>
  <string id="11912">If the number of violations you commit is within the acceptable limit, you will not be laid off.</string>
  <string id="11913">Zero violations! Great job! You are a valuable employee!</string>
  <string id="11916">Loyalty Assessment Department. It will take three days to process. Wait for the results, Carl.</string>
  <string id="11917">Carl Stein, this is the official notification of your upcoming performance assessment.</string>
  <string id="11918">You have failed the loyalty assessment. You have comitted more than the maximum number of allowable violations.</string>
  <string id="11919">You have passed the assessment. You have not exceeded the maximum number of allowable violations. Continue working.</string>
  <string id="11920">All of the paperwork and notes the investigator collected for your case have been transferred to the LAD.</string>
  <string id="11921">You will also be arrested for sabotage. Is that clear, Carl?</string>
  <string id="11922">We are very disappointed. Your ride is on its way. Farewell, Carl.</string>
  <string id="11923">Carl Stein! These are your assessment results.</string>
  <string id="11924">Remember, there's room to grow.</string>
  <string id="11925">And don't leave the city. Understood?</string>
  <string id="11927">What will be the results of the assessment?</string>
  <string id="11928">Thank you for your work!</string>
  <string id="11929">What are the results of the assessment?</string>
  <string id="11930">I see. What if it's the other way around?</string>
  <string id="11932">Goodbye, Carl.</string>
  <string id="11935">Yes. Thank you...</string>
  <string id="11936">That makes sense.</string>
  <string id="12961">Since your son is underage, you'll be fined $5,000 for the damage he did to the Central Bank.</string>
  <string id="12962">Your son, Patrick Stein, took part in the Central Bank robbery and was killed by police.</string>
  <string id="12963">Pay attention, Carl. Your son is a minor, so you are responsible for his actions.</string>
  <string id="12964">Citizens thinking they could leave our Great Country illegally were neutralized.</string>
  <string id="12965">I'm talking about Prof. Gorchik's family. Have you heard this name?</string>
  <string id="12966">Make sure his imaginary grief doesn't lead him to breaking the law.</string>
  <string id="12967">There was an unpleasant incident at the border today.</string>
  <string id="12968">Carl, we bring you sad news.</string>
  <string id="12971">That's what I wanted to discuss.</string>
  <string id="12972">My son was Andrea Gorchik's friend.</string>
  <string id="12973">Our condolences.</string>
  <string id="10894">Goodbye.</string>
  <string id="10112">He's a printing specialist, and will print brochures critizing the current state goverment.</string>
  <string id="10113">We're planning to go on strike at the factory in the near future and need those brochures. It won't work without them.</string>
  <string id="10114">This is a difficult time... He might be framed or lured to the other side.</string>
  <string id="10117">I'll send the money to your account. Please help comrade Grubic the best you can. He's doing an important thing.</string>
  <string id="10118">What do you think of reports written by one family member to turn in another? Is it OK?</string>
  <string id="10119">If you had tried to distribute them during the strike as planned, you'd have become a mockery.</string>
  <string id="10120">All we need to do is use that technological miracle to broadcast our ideas.</string>
  <string id="10122">All you have to do is find a way to change the frequency.</string>
  <string id="10123">Not necessarily, Carl. You just need to agree to be ready to help our movement.</string>
  <string id="10124">You have kids, and therefore must know what it means to sacrifice yourself for the sake of future generations.</string>
  <string id="10125">All I want from you is an explanation about which unit you're discussing.</string>
  <string id="10126">Oh, no! He printed the brochures. But the content is...a little different.</string>
  <string id="10127">As you know, the current government is unwilling to change.</string>
  <string id="10129">It's hard to miss it: it keeps going day and night.</string>
  <string id="10130">Our children will have a society where they won't be jailed for their choices.</string>
  <string id="10132">Total control of people, ridiculous bans on everything, no freedom of speech...</string>
  <string id="10133">What happened? Why are these horrible fairy tales being broadcasted instead of our program?</string>
  <string id="10134">What about your job, Carl? What normal society can count it appropriate?</string>
  <string id="10135">The worst part is the content that rig is cramming into our people's ears.</string>
  <string id="10136">People shudder at night when they hear the slightest sound. They're afraid someone will come and take them away.</string>
  <string id="10137">That's not good. We wanted to use the device, not break it.</string>
  <string id="10138">As soon as we hear the program we need, you'll receive your payment.</string>
  <string id="10139">The mobile propaganda unit blew up! Was that your work, Danton?!</string>
  <string id="10140">I'm afraid your refusal can lead to unpleasant consequences for both of us.</string>
  <string id="10141">I know how to cheer you up. We'll send you a small amount of money as compensation.</string>
  <string id="10143">You can earn the money you so desperately need for your family.</string>
  <string id="10144">Find an apartment in your wonderful building for our faithful comrade.</string>
  <string id="10145">Describe your perception of the state of our country. I must know why I'm putting myself at risk.</string>
  <string id="10146">I knew it! There IS something behind your chatter about a better tomorrow.</string>
  <string id="10147">What happened? Why didn't you do anything with that talking box?</string>
  <string id="10148">That was such an easy assignment! I'm afraid our friendship is threatened now.</string>
  <string id="10150">What if I refuse to deal with you? And report you to the quarter?</string>
  <string id="10151">Will you offer to sacrifice someone else? Me, for example?</string>
  <string id="10152">If you don't force me to help the revolutionary movement...</string>
  <string id="10153">To hell with it; I'll do it. It doesn't look hard.</string>
  <string id="10154">No! I will not take part in your shady activities!</string>
  <string id="10155">Do you realize what I'll have to listen to from my superiors now?!</string>
  <string id="10156">Our team needs your help again.</string>
  <string id="10157">I do the job I was assigned. I don't have a choice.</string>
  <string id="10159">But we have a plan that will advance our cause.</string>
  <string id="10160">Antoine Grubic? I'll see what I can do.</string>
  <string id="10161">Why do you need an explanation, Carl? You already know everything.</string>
  <string id="10162">I have a family. I must know what you're getting me into.</string>
  <string id="10163">His name is Antoine Grubic. He will stay in the building for about a week.</string>
  <string id="10164">Should I even mention that the job will pay well?</string>
  <string id="10165">Don't tell him what we know. He must do what he has to.</string>
  <string id="10166">You've surely noticed the propaganda near your building.</string>
  <string id="10167">That's too bad, Carl. Take care of yourself and your family.</string>
  <string id="10169">This will be the beginning of our collaboration.</string>
  <string id="10170">Antoine leaves today. Don't miss tomorrow's newspapers!</string>
  <string id="10171">Protect him, Carl. Don't let him do what cannot be changed.</string>
  <string id="10172">I'll call you in a couple of days to see how you're doing.</string>
  <string id="10173">What do I get in return? Cards for clothes? Food? Soap?</string>
  <string id="10174">The lack of sleep is the least of the evils this job visits upon me.</string>
  <string id="10175">As far as I can see, I have no choice.</string>
  <string id="10176">We're trying to make the world a better place, Carl.</string>
  <string id="10177">Good afternoon, Carl. This is George Danton.</string>
  <string id="10178">Good news! An important day is coming!</string>
  <string id="10179">Thanks, Carl! The New Tomorrow movement will not forget this!</string>
  <string id="10180">I couldn't find the necessary frequency.</string>
  <string id="10181">Let's say I agree... How much will you pay me?</string>
  <string id="10182">I don't want to kill anyone...</string>
  <string id="10183">None of the tenants can sleep well!</string>
  <string id="10185">That wasn't us, Carl. I swear!</string>
  <string id="10186">You should have received the money already.</string>
  <string id="10187">The New Tomorrow movement. Why are you being sarcastic, Carl?</string>
  <string id="10188">Help us and spy. Do you understand me?</string>
  <string id="10189">You did the right thing when you told me everything.</string>
  <string id="10190">It's impossible with the current government.</string>
  <string id="10191">We'll owe you if you hide him.</string>
  <string id="10192">Our unit has friends everywhere.</string>
  <string id="10193">Antoine is very important to our unit.</string>
  <string id="10195">We might have become best friends.</string>
  <string id="10196">I've thought this was your work, Carl.</string>
  <string id="10197">You always have a choice! Help us, Carl!</string>
  <string id="10198">One can fry eggs without breaking them.</string>
  <string id="10199">Great, Carl! Be careful!</string>
  <string id="10200">I repeat: we have friends everywhere.</string>
  <string id="10202">What's your unit's name?</string>
  <string id="10203">Unit of Confident Revolutionists?</string>
  <string id="10204">Your person turned out to be a diversionist.</string>
  <string id="10206">Is that a pirate radio station?</string>
  <string id="10207">Grubic tortured me with orders.</string>
  <string id="10208">No, your protégé is doing fine.</string>
  <string id="10209">I'm disappointed in you, Carl.</string>
  <string id="10210">What's going on, Carl?!</string>
  <string id="10211">Hello, Carl. This is Danton.</string>
  <string id="10212">Do you have information for me?</string>
  <string id="10213">Are you threatening me and my family?!</string>
  <string id="10215">I don't know what you're talking about.</string>
  <string id="10216">You're very smart, Carl.</string>
  <string id="10217">Of course not, Carl. How could I?</string>
  <string id="10218">I really don't have a choice...</string>
  <string id="10220">Yes, I understand you.</string>
  <string id="10221">He didn't print the brochures, did he?</string>
  <string id="10222">Where did you take my number?</string>
  <string id="10223">Do you think I'm an idiot?</string>
  <string id="10224">Remember: frequency 101.9.</string>
  <string id="10226">What do you want from me?</string>
  <string id="10227">I never doubted you.</string>
  <string id="10228">ASK ABOUT THE PERSON</string>
  <string id="10229">ASK ABOUT THE REWARD</string>
  <string id="10231">TALK ABOUT THE COUNTRY</string>
  <string id="10234">Thanks, Carl.</string>
  <string id="10237">AGREE TO HELP</string>
  <string id="10238">Who's that?</string>
  <string id="10239">Hello, Carl!</string>
  <string id="10240">Now what?</string>
  <string id="10241">Goodbye…</string>
  <string id="10242">How?</string>
  <string id="10247">$3,000</string>
  <string id="10632">Trust me, you'll have time to sleep in after we've dealt with those social parasites!</string>
  <string id="10637">Aglow has always been a small town; it basically ceased to exist after that "operation."</string>
  <string id="10639">But you said there would be a lot of people! I hope this will give you peace of mind.</string>
  <string id="10640">This man might turn out to be a general specializing in suppressing peaceful protests.</string>
  <string id="10641">The main enterprise, the clock factory, closed. Now it's a ghost town.</string>
  <string id="10642">Yes, he's a retired general; I think he's supposed to lecture at the university.</string>
  <string id="10643">Over 600 people dead and several thousand injured.</string>
  <string id="10644">You're absolutely right. Among the other things, the Butcher was in charge of the Toucan operation.</string>
  <string id="10650">I know it was a hard decision to make. Things like that always leave a mark.</string>
  <string id="10653">Sorry, it's not easy for me to suppress me emotions. My nephew died there…</string>
  <string id="10654">Let me guess... You want me to find something confirming your theory?</string>
  <string id="10656">And I've heard he's scheduled to give a speech at the stadium...</string>
  <string id="10657">We've heard there's a certain Airel Johnson living in your building.</string>
  <string id="10658">Find proof he took part in that operation!</string>
  <string id="10660">This monster escaped due to your inaction! Are you happy?</string>
  <string id="10661">Two years ago, he practically drowned that town in blood!</string>
  <string id="10667">It's just a matter of time until more innocent people are killed!</string>
  <string id="10670">First they were deprived of their minds, then their future…. They're nothing but meat now.</string>
  <string id="10674">We've long known him as the Aglow Butcher.</string>
  <string id="10677">Four hundred rookies against a battalion of tanks!</string>
  <string id="10678">Carl! I can't thank you enough…</string>
  <string id="10683">I can't remember when I last slept, Danton.</string>
  <string id="10691">If I'm not mistaken, this is a cover-up.</string>
  <string id="10696">And that's not the only case!</string>
  <string id="10702">Call me if it's him.</string>
  <string id="10706">Carl, it's Danton again.</string>
  <string id="10708">And was rewarded for this!</string>
  <string id="10709">Damn you, Carl!</string>
  <string id="10712">What operation?</string>
  <string id="10714">It was a real bloodbath.</string>
  <string id="10719">My condolences...</string>
  <string id="13002">The medicine is behind the flower pot on the first floor. Our courier put it there.</string>
  <string id="13003">As soon as Antoine is safe, I'll give you the medicine.</string>
  <string id="13004">She needs medicine I can't get here, Liebespirit.</string>
  <string id="13005">Danton, you know my daughter is sick.</string>
  <string id="13006">TALK ABOUT MARTHA'S MEDICINE</string>
  <string id="13007">Can you get it?</string>
  <string id="13008">No problem, Carl!</string>
  <string id="11110">Now they're creating gas that can switch off the tentorium glands and damage the prefrontal cerebral cortex.</string>

  <string id="11314">You have to examine the device to find out which type of bomb it is.</string>
  <string id="11321">We sent you manuals on defusing each type of bomb.</string>
  <string id="11336">Check the mailbox!</string>
  <string id="11308">Type 3: GUGB-43. Digital timer; two closed circuits; pyro powder.</string>
  <string id="11309">Type 1: MGB-53. Wristwatch timer; six closed circuits; six sticks of dynamite.</string>
  <string id="11310">Type 2: NKVD-41. Alarm clock timer; one closed circuit; nitroglycerine.</string>
  <string id="11342">LEARN ABOUT BOMB TYPES (MINISTRY)</string>
  <string id="11341">Did you defuse the bomb?</string>
  <string id="11343">Thankfully, yes.</string>
  <string id="11319">Good job, Carl. You saved our citizens and the property of the state.</string>
  <string id="11328">You've earned a reward.</string>
  <string id="11327">Inga Birkenfeld is a valuable member of our society.</string>
  <string id="11322">She's currently working on an important project...</string>
  <string id="11312">Your job is to not interfere but to provide her with the ability to work when needed…</string>

  <string id="10718">Damn Butcher!</string>
  <string id="10710">Are you insane?!</string>
  <string id="10662">That's the Johnson we need! I found a medal he won for participating in this operation…</string>
  <string id="10646">Asking you to do this isn't easy, Carl, but you have to help us get rid of that monster…</string>
  <string id="10688">Carl, difficult times require harsh measures!</string>
  <string id="10630">He won't stop; he'll keep doing what he's best at: getting rid of those who think differently than him.</string>
  <string id="10638">According to the methodic manuals we acquired, his methods rely on technology!</string>
  <string id="10665">And this is being done to peaceful citizens! Students! They're children, Carl!</string>
  <string id="10693">I suppose you're right... But... Murder?</string>
  <string id="10635">You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. He must die so he can no longer give speeches to schoolkids!</string>
  <string id="10699">He's a monster!</string>
  <string id="10716">Will you help me?</string>
  <string id="10705">AGREE TO KILL</string>
  <string id="10666">I can't believe I'm saying this... But... OK... What do you want me to do?</string>
  <string id="10669">You're doing the right thing, Carl! Trust me.</string>
  <string id="10652">We haven't had much time to plan, so I've been able to come up with only three ways of dealing with him.</string>
  <string id="10628">Poisoning is the simplest way. You risk nothing. They'll say it was an accident or a mistake.</string>
  <string id="10680">Everyone knows he's a glutton and an alcoholic.</string>
  <string id="10682">Unfortunately, don't have enough time to acquire the poison.</string>
  <string id="10713">What are the other ways?</string>
  <string id="10692">The second way is riskier...</string>
  <string id="10647">You would lure the Butcher to the corner; our hitman would take it from there.</string>
  <string id="10689">What if he misses? Johnson would report me!</string>
  <string id="10715">He won't miss!</string>
  <string id="10685">He lost two sons because of Johnson...</string>
  <string id="10645">He's already there; all you need to do is to make sure the general's there, too.</string>
  <string id="10648">There is a third way. It's the most effective, but there would be consequence for you.</string>
  <string id="10627">You would deliver a box with a bomb to him. Johnson won't refuse a gift from his fans. Understand?</string>
  <string id="10690">Yes. He's quite vain.</string>
  <string id="10633">That's right. There will be an explosion in your building. But only in his apartment, and we will compensate you for the damages.</string>
  <string id="10649">I will give you the so-called gift. But it's up to you to choose how to deal with that scumbag.</string>
  <string id="10673">Remember, we don't have much time. He'll be moving out soon.</string>
  <string id="13171">Our man will give you the box at the corner of the building.</string>
  <string id="10245">REFUSE</string>
  <string id="10701">No! Killing someone is going too far!</string>
  <string id="10697">It's unthinkable!</string>
  <string id="10672">I'm sorry to hear that, Carl. I guess we'll have to resort to other means.</string>
  <string id="10629">But I don't think you'd like your son to be taken to war and returned in a coffin.</string>
  <string id="10703">Danton! It's your fault!</string>
  <string id="10636">A peaceful assembly at the stadium turned into a riot. Someone fired at Johnson!</string>
  <string id="10659">The troops subdued the riot, and my son, Patrick, was killed...</string>
  <string id="10704">My son died because of you!</string>
  <string id="10664">No, Carl, it was your fault!</string>
  <string id="10634">With your help, everything would have turned out differently! Nobody would've stopped the demonstration and your son would've survived.</string>
  <string id="10679">But you're the ones who started that damn riot…</string>
  <string id="10676">Everybody's doing what they can. But hardly anyone's doing what they should.</string>
  <string id="10668">It's unfortunate, but you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs...</string>
  <string id="10695">Eggs? That's what you think of the people who died?</string>
  <string id="10694">How are you different from Aglow Butcher?</string>
  <string id="10686">We mean well.</string>

  <string id="2363">That's a strange claim. Are you sure you want this job?</string>
  <string id="2364">If not, you must leave before you and your family unpack.</string>
  <string id="2366">Set up a surveillance camera. This is important.</string>

  <string id="2421">However, you can call me anytime from your office using your private line and ask me anything.</string>

  <string id="13449">Will you place a bet?</string>
  <string id="13450">What are the results?</string>
  <string id="13451">Good luck.</string>
  <string id="13452">Don't keep me dangling!</string>
  <string id="13453">Interested?</string>
  <string id="6681">I hope so. Anyway, I'll wait on the court and then make my decision. I won't stay in this apartment any longer.</string>
  <string id="6682">This apartment once belonged to us. We threw wonderful parties featuring music and poetry.</string>
  <string id="6683">I dream of owning a house on the southern coast. Maybe we could even have kids...</string>
  <string id="6684">Leaving by train won't be easy. I couldn't buy a ticket. That must have been a mistake!</string>
  <string id="6685">Klaus likes &lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#D53838FF&gt;taking photos &lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. This will cheer him up.</string>
  <string id="6688">Klaus has a delicate psyche. He wouldn't be able to withstand even five minutes of abuse.</string>
  <string id="6689">I've heard that the police beat the most insane confessions out of people.</string>
  <string id="6690">I gave you my biggest saucepan. I hope your wife will like it.</string>
  <string id="6691">I'm sure your husband has no ill will. I'll pack my things and leave the apartment as soon as I can.</string>
  <string id="6692">I'll make sure Martha never sees you again. I have nothing to lose, thanks to you.</string>
  <string id="6693">Now I see you'll blackmail even your own daughter - with no hesitation!</string>
  <string id="6694">I think they can't forgive us for being wealthy once.</string>
  <string id="6695">There's no need for this. My husband and I live alone, and we don't touch this.</string>
  <string id="6696">I'm a court clerk, and I can tell you there's no way your husband is ever getting out of jail.</string>
  <string id="6697">He's done nothing wrong, but the State always suspects him of doing horrible things.</string>
  <string id="6702">These books... It was a matter of principle to not bring them to the Banned Items Collections Center.</string>
  <string id="6703">Your duty is to report that your husband is a traitor!</string>
  <string id="6704">To be honest, the neighboring cities are just like this one. At least here, I have a job.</string>
  <string id="6705">What are you talking about? He's never done anything wrong!</string>
  <string id="6707">My wife wants to make a compote, but we lost our saucepan while moving in.</string>
  <string id="6708">The lives of my loved ones are at stake. Have you seen my daughter? I can't take this risk.</string>
  <string id="6709">Time heals all wounds. I'm sure he'll be out in two years. Everything will be fine!</string>
  <string id="6710">I had to turn in your husband. He was keeping banned books.</string>
  <string id="6711">I bet there's a special cauldron for you in Hell! And I hope you boil in it forever!</string>
  <string id="6714">There's one law for everyone. Don't you understand? You're an accomplice!</string>
  <string id="6715">Your husband is a traitor! He betrayed the nation! He must be executed by firing squad!</string>
  <string id="6716">Klaus doesn't even have an absentee certificate. Can you imagine?</string>
  <string id="6717">I'm sure you'll find a way to leave the city and move as far away as you can.</string>
  <string id="6718">I'm sorry, Carl! I didn't think about how that could put your family at risk.</string>
  <string id="6720">He's a good man! You must see this.</string>
  <string id="6721">They just arrived and arrested Klaus! They beat him before dragging him away!</string>
  <string id="6722">Klaus thinks I don't understand anything! My poor husband...</string>
  <string id="6723">Can you do me a favor? Can I borrow your saucepan?</string>
  <string id="6726">Hello! My name is Carl, I'm the new building manager.</string>
  <string id="6727">How is your husband doing? He looked upset.</string>
  <string id="6728">Please accept this as my housewarming gift.</string>
  <string id="6729">I'm sure he'll be jailed for life, or even shot!</string>
  <string id="6730">This is unbearable. I can't live without him!</string>
  <string id="6731">You'd better talk to Klaus about this.</string>
  <string id="6733">Alas, such people are not welcome here.</string>
  <string id="6734">You're a liar! You're spitting falsehoods through your teeth.</string>
  <string id="6735">We're lucky you've decided to help us!</string>
  <string id="6736">No, Carl. We can't do anything.</string>
  <string id="6737">I understand. You'd better leave.</string>
  <string id="6738">This can't be true... It can't be...</string>
  <string id="6739">They beat him... I saw it with my own eyes...</string>
  <string id="6740">TALK ABOUT THE ABSENTEE CERTIFICATE</string>
  <string id="6741">Otherwise, we'd have already left...</string>
  <string id="6742">Thank you! We'll bring it back.</string>
  <string id="6744">You're worse than the police jackals!</string>
  <string id="6745">I have a suitable saucepan.</string>
  <string id="6746">It's nice to meet you. I'm Maria Schimmer.</string>
  <string id="6747">What are you going to do next?</string>
  <string id="6748">TALK ABOUT YOUR PLANS</string>
  <string id="6749">ASK ABOUT ESCAPING THE CITY</string>

  <string id="6754">USE YOUR JOB AND FAMILY AS AN EXCUSE</string>
  <string id="6756">I don't know what happened...</string>
  <string id="6757">Your husband's concerns are not unfounded...</string>
  <string id="6758">Did you bring your family here?</string>
  <string id="6759">Here it is.</string>
  <string id="6760">He has troubles at work.</string>
  <string id="6761">TALK ABOUT THE HUSBAND'S ARREST</string>

  <string id="6781">CHEER HER UP</string>
  <string id="6782">FRIGHTEN HER</string>
  <string id="8821">But she spends everything on groceries because she can't allow Alloisius to eat junk.</string>
  <string id="8822">I'd like to talk about Sarah, Alloisius's, um, friend.</string>
  <string id="8823">I don't know what to say.</string>
  <string id="8825">TALK ABOUT SARAH WATTERMACH</string>
  <string id="9081">It's nice to meet you!</string>
  <string id="9721">Also, she &lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#D53838FF&gt;loves flowers&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. She recently told me she could buy them every day</string>
  <string id="9722">One cannot change one's job without the approval of the Ministry of Distribution. You know this.</string>
  <string id="9723">Thanks to you, Klaus' documents are fine. We're anxious to leave this city.</string>
  <string id="9724">Maria, I don't know what to say. Do you have another place to stay?</string>
  <string id="9725">He doesn't feel well. He received a parcel containing a reel of film.</string>
  <string id="9726">What do they want? They've taken EVERYTHING from us! When will this stop?</string>
  <string id="9728">Forgive me, Maria. This is my job.</string>
  <string id="9729">My husband is feeling down these days. I hope he hasn't offended you.</string>
  <string id="9730">But he's an honest man, and will never go against his conscience!</string>
  <string id="9731">I don't know... Klaus is my only close friend.</string>
  <string id="9732">We just moved in. It would be nice to meet you.</string>
  <string id="9733">Right. He's as good as dead now.</string>
  <string id="9734">She spends a lot of time in the kitchen.</string>
  <string id="9735">I'm sure you can deal with your sorrow.</string>
  <string id="9736">Luggage... We've packed everything...</string>
  <string id="9738">Tell about the husband</string>
  <string id="9739">Hello</string>
  <string id="14633">FURNITURE REPAIR</string>
  <string id="14634">I'm here on business. I need to repair the furniture in your apartment.</string>
  <string id="14635">Come in!</string>
  <string id="6784">It'll be fixed soon. I can't help, although I'd be glad to assist you in any other way.</string>
  <string id="6788">My wife asked me to ask you if you could write a prescription so she doesn't have to go to the hospital.</string>
  <string id="6790">I don't want to scare you, but Martha isn't well. She has bibasilar rales in the lower half of both lungs...</string>
  <string id="6791">I have a request. A very private one...</string>
  <string id="6792">She says nobody called her but us. Poor thing...</string>
  <string id="6793">I'm confused and blushing, and every inch of my extremely gifted self is sweating profusely!</string>
  <string id="6796">Clara broke my heart... But I can't throw her out. Please do something!</string>
  <string id="6797">You have to go to the hospital, or trade with those who don't need it.</string>
  <string id="6798">Can you find me a chocolate bar? It's not OK to show up for a date emptyhanded...</string>
  <string id="6801">But no... I keep worrying about our neighbors... I mean all people!</string>
  <string id="6802">Your wife is amazing, Carl. You clearly know a lot about dealing with women.</string>
  <string id="6804">I know it's hard to believe that looking at me, but...</string>
  <string id="6806">Sorry, I got carried away. So what did you want to talk about?</string>
  <string id="6807">You must've heard about me. The entire city did!</string>
  <string id="6809">She'd be a good woman to have in the bedroom and the kitchen!</string>
  <string id="6810">I'm on the verge of perishing. Make her go away. She disappointed me!</string>
  <string id="6812">I haven't even met all of my neighbors yet.</string>
  <string id="6814">I'm ecstatic. Clara is incredible! Thank you!</string>
  <string id="6817">I'm very shy around women.</string>
  <string id="6818">I'm not one to pat myself on the back. I was just doing my duty!</string>
  <string id="6819">It breaks my heart to say this - but no...</string>
  <string id="6820">Any preference? Who would you like to meet?</string>
  <string id="6821">I'm here to introduce myself. I'm Carl, the landlord.</string>
  <string id="6822">And what can I do? Get you some deodorant?</string>
  <string id="6823">She should visit her aunt soon.</string>
  <string id="6825">That's cruel, Carl! You're playing with people's feelings!</string>
  <string id="6826">But I have no right to prescribe or receive medication.</string>
  <string id="6829">She danced and sang while I was dying of a terrible headache.</string>
  <string id="6830">Oh, busy, busy, busy...</string>
  <string id="6831">I like it when you stop by to talk.</string>
  <string id="6832">Keeps singing all day long.</string>
  <string id="6834">I just moved in here, dear.</string>
  <string id="6836">Here's a good way for you to relax!</string>
  <string id="6837">I'll let you know when I'm ready to talk.</string>
  <string id="6838">Great! I'm definitely going again!</string>
  <string id="6839">I'm disappointed! She's not what I thought she was!</string>
  <string id="6840">I'm sure they're all great people. And your... Ummm...</string>
  <string id="6841">Good day, Alloisius. Do you have any aspirin?</string>
  <string id="6842">Oh, what problems could I possibly have?</string>
  <string id="6844">Everything is fine, thanks. I wanted to ask about...</string>
  <string id="6845">Why does everyone like these pills?</string>
  <string id="6846">Smoking kills!</string>
  <string id="6847">Please don't praise me. I was just doing my duty.</string>
  <string id="6848">Really? Did you just get here?</string>
  <string id="6850">Great! I'm ready to go on a date!</string>
  <string id="6851">Let me know if you need anything.</string>
  <string id="6852">Your doubts hurt me...</string>
  <string id="6853">The number is 237-451. Call her; she's waiting.</string>
  <string id="6856">Wait... I need to think.</string>
  <string id="6857">And no sign of remorse!</string>

  <string id="6865">How are you doing? And how is the family?</string>
  <string id="6866">I'm honored. I'm Dr. Alloisius Shpak, a physician.</string>

  <string id="6869">I've dedicated my life to treating people!</string>
  <string id="6871">She's smart and beautiful!</string>
  <string id="6873">Sarah makes me happy!</string>
  <string id="6874">That's the REAL one! Don't you doubt it!</string>
  <string id="6875">Just kidding! I didn't find you a girlfriend.</string>
  <string id="6877">I'd say especially healthy!</string>

  <string id="6937">Are you a doctor?</string>
  <string id="6938">Are you kidding?</string>
  <string id="6939">I bought it!</string>
  <string id="6940">...</string>
  <string id="8283">Local medication will only make it worse. And it's already serious... Delays could result in a fatality...</string>
  <string id="8284">She needs antibiotics ASAP. And, as much as I love domestic medicine, she needs the imported stuff.</string>
  <string id="8285">In any case, I've made my decision. Carl, I'd be very grateful if you helped me with my wedding.</string>
  <string id="8286">Don't worry about me, dear. You saw Shpak in love; now you'll see Shpak heartbroken.</string>
  <string id="8287">And pay your annual tax. It's all legal, Carl, so don't worry. I keep trinkets only at home.</string>
  <string id="8288">Take those cruise tickets. I wanted to go with Clara, but will now dedicate all my time to work.</string>
  <string id="8289">I never knew you were romantic. I always use books. People rarely read nowadays.</string>
  <string id="8290">All you needed to do to find this out was stop by for dinner.</string>
  <string id="8291">I bought cruise tickets to the Southern shore for our honeymoon. All thanks to you!</string>
  <string id="8292">And I bought the cruise tickets... I think they'll make you happier than me!</string>
  <string id="8293">Take it, Carl. Perhaps it'll bring you happiness. I'm going to console myself with work.</string>
  <string id="8295">I owe you! And I'll definitely treat you to a slice of chicken innards pie! It's delicious!</string>
  <string id="8296">No thief will check the bookshelf and try to read the medical encyclopedia.</string>
  <string id="8297">I bought a ring for my wife, but I don't know where to hide it until it's time to give it to her.</string>
  <string id="8298">Women have been breaking my heart since I was a kid. That's why I became a cardiosurgeon.</string>
  <string id="8299">It was going well. I even bought the tickets for the cruise. And now I have no use for them!</string>
  <string id="8300">It wasn't your fault; you became unwittingly tangled up in that scandal. I want to make it up to you.</string>
  <string id="8301">But I have a request. I want to make Sarah a gift, but I don't know her very well...</string>
  <string id="8304">The very thought of those crazy college parties... Don't mind me, Carl.</string>
  <string id="8305">Great! Let's get together in two days! I'll talk with the neighbors!</string>
  <string id="8306">I'd be very grateful if you helped me with the wedding, Carl.</string>
  <string id="8307">Saving people 24/7 is my civic duty!</string>
  <string id="8308">I heard there was an accident in the Northern mines.</string>
  <string id="8309">She didn't just leave, she stole the family jewels!</string>
  <string id="8310">Quotes, prescriptions, regulations... I'm risking a lot to help your baby!</string>
  <string id="8311">It's $[$balance_doctor_money] per course. Sorry, but I couldn't find anything cheaper.</string>
  <string id="8312">It's my fault. I shouldn't have told her about mom's golden brooch...</string>
  <string id="8313">She took my collection of rare wines to her friends, and didn't even apologize!</string>
  <string id="8314">If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have become the happiest man in the world!</string>
  <string id="8315">Sarah was arrested! They're saying she's an imposter!</string>
  <string id="8316">I'm a loser, Carl. In both love and cards.</string>
  <string id="8317">Take it. I don't want any reminders...</string>
  <string id="8318">Thankfully, I'm not a student anymore, so I think singing will be enough.</string>
  <string id="8319">How could you do that to me, Carl? I thought we were friends.</string>
  <string id="8320">Really? That's strange, but let's see...</string>
  <string id="8321">A veil is a luxury. I'll do all I can to find it for you.</string>
  <string id="8322">There's a woman on your doorstep. She says she came to see you.</string>
  <string id="8324">I need your advice. Where's a perfect place to hide something valuable?</string>
  <string id="8325">Sarah definitely needs it! It's white and lacey...</string>
  <string id="8327">Here, take the money. You're saving me from being alone!</string>
  <string id="8328">It's perfect! Thank you!</string>
  <string id="8329">Sarah is incredible. What a cook!</string>
  <string id="8330">No! You're trying to destroy my happiness! Go away!</string>
  <string id="8331">I can't stay in the same apartment as that woman!</string>
  <string id="8332">Everybody lies...</string>
  <string id="8333">She's wonderful. Thank you! I respected you before, too.</string>
  <string id="8334">TELL HIM ALLOISIUS IS THE BEST GIFT</string>
  <string id="8335">I don't even know what she likes.</string>
  <string id="8336">Sarah left me... I'm crushed...</string>
  <string id="8337">I don't believe you. Leave! And don't come back!</string>
  <string id="8338">Don't you dare lie about my Sarah!</string>
  <string id="8339">Calm down, Alloisius, and let's talk!</string>
  <string id="8340">I feel like singing and dancing naked in the moonlight!</string>
  <string id="8341">I cure people's hearts. What else is left for me to do?</string>
  <string id="8342">That rascal! What are you going to do?</string>
  <string id="8343">Can you ask around about her?</string>
  <string id="8345">No caches with family jewels.</string>
  <string id="8347">I'll buy her flowers! A million red roses!</string>
  <string id="8349">I have nothing for you. Go away.</string>
  <string id="8350">That's your problem.</string>
  <string id="8351">SAY SHE LOVES COOKING</string>
  <string id="8353">MENTION THE WOMAN AT THE DOOR</string>
  <string id="8354">I'm all ears, Carl.</string>
  <string id="8355">SAY SHE LOVES FLOWERS</string>
  <string id="8356">Oh, no. This woman is unworthy!</string>
  <string id="8357">She's an imposter!</string>
  <string id="8358">Here. What do you think?</string>
  <string id="8359">TALK ABOUT GATHERING INFO</string>
  <string id="8360">Do you regret Clara leaving?</string>
  <string id="8361">Where do you keep the valuables?</string>
  <string id="8362">You asked me to find out about Sarah...</string>
  <string id="8363">What are you talking about, Alloisius?!</string>
  <string id="8364">TALK ABOUT JEWELS</string>
  <string id="8365">SAY SHE'S NOT SARAH</string>

  <string id="9779">OK</string>
  <string id="12878">Don't expect a miracle on the first day. The medicine needs to accumulate in your daughter's system, and even then, it's unlikely it will fully heal her.</string>
  <string id="12879">It's nothing! I'm happy to help. Children are the colors of a nation. And we have only two colors today: black and white.</string>
  <string id="12880">I understand everybody eats sausages and pasta, but your daughter needs to consume a more balanced diet.</string>
  <string id="12881">You are very impatient! Believe me - I want your daughter to get better.</string>
  <string id="12882">I'm not taking advantage of your grief, I just don't have this medicine at home.</string>
  <string id="12883">Yes. Here it is. Tell your wife to read the instructions carefully. Follow them closely and everything will be OK!</string>
  <string id="12884">Probably. But now you must provide a warm place and good nutrition for your daughter.</string>
  <string id="12885">Carl, I have no doubt. Give it to me faster, and I'll get the medicine for you.</string>
  <string id="12886">I'll let you know when I have the medicine in my hands.</string>
  <string id="12887">You can decrease the risk of a lethal outcome.</string>
  <string id="12888">Does that mean she'll need something else? Another treatment?</string>

  <string id="12890">Could you bring the medicine now and then take the money for it?</string>
  <string id="12891">I'm sorry, Carl. But the situation is quite the contrary.</string>
  <string id="12892">Thank you for helping us acquire the medicine for our daughter!</string>

  <string id="14638">Come in!</string>
  <string id="6942">You're loafing around the house doing nothing! And I've cleaned the floor! The least you could do is go buy sweets for our daughter!</string>
  <string id="6943">Go meet him. And buy sweets for Martha. The poor thing hasn't had a treat for months.</string>
  <string id="6944">How on Earth would I know why he's wearing a top hat? Stop bothering me with your silly questions!</string>
  <string id="6945">We visited her doctor already! He said to give her aspirin and clean her nose with dish soap.</string>
  <string id="6947">Anna, do you want me to risk our family for the sake of the Schimmers? This conversation is over.</string>
  <string id="6948">If he has a surgeon's license, then he has a stamp. And if he has a stamp, he can write a prescription.</string>
  <string id="6950">I don't know anything about that. He's a surgeon; he operates on people. Why would he need to prescribe medicine?</string>
  <string id="6951">No, it's just a fever. But I don't like how she feels.</string>
  <string id="6953">The old woman on the second floor showed me the perfumed soap she bought from him last month.</string>
  <string id="6955">They say he tried to free his wife. He went to the police and was shot!</string>
  <string id="6956">I'll be fine. You're not being silly, right? I'll do a good job.</string>
  <string id="6957">Please hurry! Martha dulled my brain with this cartoon.</string>
  <string id="6958">Alloisius Shpak doesn't have permission to write prescriptions.</string>
  <string id="6959">At least pretend you care about our kid and fix this damned TV!</string>
  <string id="6960">I just asked you to buy chocolate for our little one!</string>
  <string id="6961">Are they more important than our family? Fix this damned TV!</string>
  <string id="6962">I registered the kids, and don't want to go back to the hospital.</string>
  <string id="6963">They perform too many tests on children and use rare antibiotics.</string>
  <string id="6965">Find some money, Carl, even if you have to rob a bank to do it!</string>
  <string id="6966">What if he's at Martha's? She always plays near the porch!</string>
  <string id="6967">Everything would have been different if they'd stayed within law.</string>
  <string id="6968">Things are bad, Carl! He said it's pneumonia with several side effects.</string>
  <string id="6970">What if the previous manager had thought like this, too? Well, it's time to go back to work.</string>
  <string id="6971">They say he's selling new household supplies.</string>
  <string id="6972">They're really nice! How can you be this hard-hearted?</string>
  <string id="6973">I saw the police march a handcuffed person right by me... It frightened me!</string>
  <string id="6976">Let the Schimmers start their life from scratch. I hope they can do it.</string>
  <string id="6978">I hate to say this, but maybe they got their just desserts.</string>
  <string id="6979">I didn't even ask for a bar of strawberry perfumed soap for myself...</string>
  <string id="6980">I hope they won't reject the new manager. I'll make a compote for Martha and bring it back.</string>
  <string id="6981">It looks like water because we have neither sugar nor apples!</string>
  <string id="6982">Schimmer was a traitor, and his wife Maria hid his crooked ways.</string>
  <string id="6983">Have you read the newspaper, Carl? The barge on which the Schimmers were sailing wrecked!</string>
  <string id="6986">Martha and I paid a visit to a professor. He's a child specialist.</string>
  <string id="6988">How horrible! How could that have happened? What did she drink?</string>
  <string id="6989">Cheer up, sweetheart! Now we have enough sugar.</string>
  <string id="6990">If you cannot agree with the doctor, Carl...</string>
  <string id="6991">I don't know... Maybe this is because we live in the basement.</string>
  <string id="6993">Have you heard, Carl? Klaus went mad after Maria's arrest!</string>
  <string id="6994">I waited in line forever only to find out I needed a prescription.</string>
  <string id="6995">It breaks my heart to think of you being in his place.</string>
  <string id="6996">Please ask. I'll make your favorite meatballs.</string>
  <string id="6997">I left him alone in the kitchen, and he told me many things!</string>
  <string id="6998">Maria tried to commit suicide after that!</string>
  <string id="6999">It's not my fault that you couldn't get a provision card for sugar.</string>
  <string id="7000">Have you found a saucepan, Carl? I've prepared everything for the compote.</string>
  <string id="7002">The previous building manager. He didn't handle his duties well.</string>
  <string id="7003">I understand you have a million important things to do, Carl.</string>
  <string id="7004">The same cartoon is on every day!</string>
  <string id="7005">OK! Since this is about Martha's health, I'll ask him if I have a chance.</string>
  <string id="7007">You bought sweets, Carl! Thank you... I'm full of worry these days.</string>
  <string id="7010">I talked with our neighbors, Carl. They're really nice.</string>
  <string id="7012">Martha is sick, Carl. And we have no medicine at home.</string>
  <string id="7013">Martha feels worse, Carl. The aspirin didn't help.</string>
  <string id="7014">If you hadn't tried to help them, they might still be alive.</string>
  <string id="7016">With soap, Carl! How can I clean a kid's nose with soap?</string>
  <string id="7017">Anna, have you seen the old doll Martha used to play with?</string>
  <string id="7019">This is why she's upset and afraid to talk to me!</string>
  <string id="7020">I searched every nook and cranny, and I have no idea where it is!</string>
  <string id="7021">Thank you for moving in a doctor, Carl!</string>
  <string id="7023">If they had been alive, Klaus would have been jailed.</string>
  <string id="7024">I hope so. A kid shouldn't eat crunches.</string>
  <string id="7026">You're unbearable, Carl! A rope around your neck would serve you well!</string>
  <string id="7031">Thanks, honey! You're a real Jack-of-all-trades!</string>
  <string id="7032">Don't worry, honey! I'll be a good manager.</string>
  <string id="7034">Are you saying I sit around all day doing nothing?</string>
  <string id="7035">Martha might even need surgery!</string>
  <string id="7036">Thank you! I think she'll feel better for a couple of days.</string>
  <string id="7037">I don't have anything like that now, but you can take a look at our other useful items.</string>
  <string id="7038">Oh, Carl! When did you change?</string>
  <string id="7040">Find out if he writes prescriptions from home.</string>
  <string id="7041">And Maria would have already been on the streets.</string>
  <string id="7043">A person in line suggested this.</string>
  <string id="7044">How could one think of such a thing?</string>
  <string id="7045">Who lives in apartment 2, Carl?</string>
  <string id="7048">Can you find some aspirin for our girl?</string>
  <string id="7049">It looked like water last time.</string>
  <string id="7050">First her husband, now her... It's horrible, Carl!</string>
  <string id="7051">Have you found aspirin, Carl? Martha is worse.</string>

  <string id="9788">Think of your daughter. She can't watch a single cartoon!</string>
  <string id="9789">Listen to me first. You never listen to what I tell you!</string>
  <string id="9790">You bought a radio? I've already chosen a spot for it - in your office!</string>
  <string id="9791">When I close my eyes, I can see those bulls leading the previous building manager out by the nose.</string>
  <string id="9792">I was told the state would reimburse for all of my expenses. We just need to be patient</string>
  <string id="9793">If you say so. Can you ask the tenants about the saucepans?</string>
  <string id="9794">First Martha's illness, now this… I can't do this anymore…</string>
  <string id="9795">You'll become acquainted with them, and talk about this and that...</string>
  <string id="9796">This general is a VIP. He's highly regarded by the Ministry.</string>
  <string id="9797">The professor said he'd do everything we need - for $[$balance_wife_money].</string>
  <string id="9798">We have an entire box of coal-tar soup I bought with our ration cards.</string>
  <string id="9799">Yes, take this. I hope this is just the flu. Everyone is sick these days.</string>
  <string id="9800">Bring it to Martha! The kid has the heebie-jeebies because of this.</string>
  <string id="9801">Do you know where I can get a veil for Alloisius' wedding, darling?</string>
  <string id="9802">It's none of your business, Anna. The Ministry of Order is in a better position to know who's guilty.</string>
  <string id="9803">That's good, because I heard tenants don't like him. Neither do I.</string>
  <string id="9804">Carl, buy us a radio. Are you a manager, or not?</string>
  <string id="9805">I need your help, honey. I can't find a big enough saucepan.</string>
  <string id="9806">This is the mobile propaganda unit. It will leave in a couple of days.</string>
  <string id="9807">They make us sad, but we'll listen anyway.</string>
  <string id="9808">Everything has been getting worse and worse since we moved here…</string>
  <string id="9809">That Airel Johnson is a glutton and a drunkard!</string>
  <string id="9810">I was told a man in a top hat walks near the house occasionally.</string>
  <string id="9811">Sweets aren't a big deal! I'll get some. Take a deep breath...</string>
  <string id="9812">But he promised to help if certain problems crop up.</string>
  <string id="9813">Klaus Schimmer was arrested, Carl! Do you know what happened?</string>
  <string id="9814">What things? Antiques? Don't you have enough things?</string>
  <string id="9815">Our state's propaganda can't disturb you. Do you understand?</string>
  <string id="9816">Don't even think of this! You must have left it in our old house.</string>
  <string id="9817">It's too loud. It's OK during the day, but it's really disturbing at night.</string>
  <string id="9818">Maybe someone stole it. Should we call the police?</string>
  <string id="9819">Damn it! Am I the only one doing my job?</string>
  <string id="9820">It was blown up. I'm in the process of finding the culprit.</string>
  <string id="9821">I did, I did. Stop nagging me, Anna, here's your radio.</string>
  <string id="9822">Take care of the breakage, please. Or call a repairman.</string>
  <string id="9823">Of course I'll find him! Do you have any news about Martha?</string>
  <string id="9824">I turned him in. He broke the law.</string>
  <string id="9826">He has the kind of face that makes you believe he could do anything.</string>
  <string id="9827">We need $[$balance_wife_money]to cure Martha.</string>
  <string id="9828">When was our leader born, Anna?</string>
  <string id="9829">You can buy some things from him.</string>
  <string id="9830">The 81.6 frequency broadcasts fairy tales for kids…</string>
  <string id="9831">I always hear the news over the phone!</string>
  <string id="9832">I found a note for you, darling.</string>
  <string id="9833">Don't get so steamed! I didn't want to offend you.</string>
  <string id="9834">I wish we could eat like that! We're going to go broke!</string>
  <string id="9835">What happened to that funny car, Carl?</string>
  <string id="9836">Maybe it's behind the wardrobe, or under the bed?</string>
  <string id="9837">No, I didn't have the time.</string>
  <string id="9838">What's that vehicle by our house?</string>
  <string id="9839">Better not say that to anyone but me.</string>
  <string id="9840">What do you want, Carl? I gave you my veil!</string>
  <string id="9841">Carl! Couldn't the same thing happen to you?</string>
  <string id="9842">I'll fix it as soon as I can.</string>
  <string id="9843">ASK TO THROW AWAY THE BOX</string>
  <string id="9844">Maybe because of the nearby mines.</string>
  <string id="9845">Is it that hard, Carl?</string>

  <string id="9854">I don't have time for this.</string>
  <string id="9855">Life is unfair...</string>
  <string id="9856">Oh, Patrick... Why?</string>
  <string id="9857">He's a professor.</string>
  <string id="9858">I'll take a look when I have time.</string>

  <string id="9871">You're welcome.</string>
  <string id="9872">Thanks!</string>
  <string id="11362">She told me she's going to bear seven kids for our Dear Leader. The first one will be a girl, and she's going to name her Directive...</string>
  <string id="11363">Have you seen her daughter? How could anyone raise a kid that way? She's weird...</string>
  <string id="11364">She's... She's very similar to Patrick. She's like he was after he returned from that place...</string>
  <string id="11365">Honestly, I'm not surprised. That's not the way to raise a child!</string>
  <string id="11366">Of course, she was a very strange woman. But I feel sorry for her.</string>
  <string id="11367">Spare your nerves, dear. Here, buy something to cheer you up.</string>
  <string id="11368">Really, Carl, I wouldn't want someone like that living next to me.</string>

  <string id="11373">I'm worried sick! We all almost died!</string>
  <string id="11375">Is that true, Carl? Was there a bomb in the building?</string>
  <string id="11376">How can you be so thick?!</string>
  <string id="11377">Have you seen her daughter? She's weird…</string>
  <string id="11378">GIVE HER MONEY TO CALM HER DOWN (-$500)</string>

  <string id="11699">On the other hand, a mute is a perfect tenant. He won't make any noise, he won't be asking for this and that...</string>
  <string id="11700">We don't want him to write any complaints about us! He has hands, you know...</string>
  <string id="11701">It took me a while to figure out his signs. Then he started grunting...</string>
  <string id="11702">Have you talked to Albert Meineke?</string>
  <string id="11703">Yes, but he didn't say anything.</string>
  <string id="11704">TALK ABOUT THE MUTE</string>
  <string id="11705">Just what we needed...</string>
  <string id="11867">I understand your attitude, but this is not a joke. We have a chance to emigrate! It's risky, but do you want to?</string>
  <string id="11868">It's a place where kids don't die because customs bulldozes over imported medicines while all our hospitals have is cotton and saline.</string>
  <string id="11869">I'm not thrilled about that, either. Who knows what they could find out about me?</string>
  <string id="11870">Anna, what do you think about us leaving the country?</string>
  <string id="11871">And they're always loading me down with impossible tasks.</string>
  <string id="11872">I think this is a bad joke, Carl. Where could we go?</string>
  <string id="11873">I want to go where my family will be safe.</string>
  <string id="11874">Are you up to something, Carl? What if you get arrested?</string>
  <string id="11875">I was notified about an upcoming assessment.</string>
  <string id="11876">I had to break more than a few rules.</string>
  <string id="11877">But, Carl, we already take risks every day!</string>
  <string id="11878">What kind of life is this? Let's leave, Carl.</string>
  <string id="11879">I'm afraid, Carl!</string>
  <string id="11880">TELL ABOUT THE ASSESSMENT</string>
  <string id="11881">TALK ABOUT THE ASSESSMENT</string>
  <string id="11882">TALK ABOUT LEAVING</string>
  <string id="11883">I'll figure something out.</string>
  <string id="11885">Oh, Carl. What should we do?</string>
  <string id="12694">Here's the medicine, Carl. The doctor says Martha will feel better soon. Then she'll have to get some lab tests done and continue her treatment.</string>
  <string id="12695">We'll see. The main thing is to keep the apartment warm and make sure Martha eats well. No more sausages and pasta, just porridge and other healthy foods.</string>
  <string id="12696">Give me Martha back. I want her and Patrick here again to make us happy. I just want life to go back to like it was. Make it so!</string>
  <string id="12697">I have a surprise for you, too. I found a golden brooch by the bus stop. None of the tenants have reported losing it...</string>
  <string id="12698">As they say, North Borea is easy to find, difficult to enter, and impossible to leave.</string>
  <string id="12699">It's been forever since she ate fruit. Patrick brought her some raspberries from the Botanical Garden, but it was only a handful...</string>
  <string id="12700">The geography teacher was arrested before the school year started for cartography sabotage.</string>
  <string id="12701">Liebespirit, or "the pure spirit," as people call it. People abroad have used it for years to cure lung disease.</string>
  <string id="12702">If we don't pay our bills, they'll cut us off. And our heating is already not that great, given how humid that basement is.</string>
  <string id="12703">I don't know, Anna. All they say to me is, "Be grateful we didn't arrest you instead."</string>
  <string id="12704">Are you kidding? It's not like I buy anything for myself! For your information, it's been three years since I bought a new pair of stockings!</string>
  <string id="12705">The only way to get it is illegally. It's against the law to import it.</string>
  <string id="12706">Nothing bad will come out of your daughter eating a juicy apple! Take one from someone and bring it home.</string>
  <string id="12707">What did you expect? He's been through Corrections. Hopefully, he'll be back to his old self sooner or later.</string>
  <string id="12708">My heart is breaking, Carl. They'll kill him at the border! They'll shoot him like a dog, my poor boy!</string>
  <string id="12709">Did you hear the Gorchiks were captured at the border? That's the family of Patrick's girlfriend. He wanted to go with them!</string>
  <string id="12710">My heart is breaking, Carl. They'll kill him at the border! They'll shoot him like a dog, my poor boy!</string>
  <string id="12711">We need a heater! Martha's feet are as cold as ice… We live in that cold basement, like rats...</string>
  <string id="12712">That's sad. But I guess the state knows better than we do who to imprison and who to execute...</string>
  <string id="12713">They believe that will strengthen the population's ability to bear cold weather.</string>
  <string id="12714">He said that'll make her feel better, but there's little hope for a complete recovery.</string>
  <string id="12715">But how?! How is that possible?! Everyone knows the difference between North and South Borea!</string>
  <string id="12716">I'll do everything I can, Anna, but I can't change the import laws.</string>
  <string id="12717">These monsters know no mercy! Our bills keep skyrocketing. Soon, all we'll be doing is working to pay them off!</string>
  <string id="12718">And when I said the last thing we needed was him, he yelled at me to be more respectful when mentioning HIM.</string>
  <string id="12719">Damn them, Carl! What's next? Taking away our air to train us to breathe underwater?</string>
  <string id="12720">To hell with the borders, Carl! Steal a tank if needed! Martha must survive by any means possible!</string>
  <string id="12721">I tried to talk him out of it, but he wouldn't listen to me. And we spend SO MUCH to cure Martha.</string>
  <string id="12722">Oh, Carl! Thank God! I'm on my way to the doctor to get the medicine!</string>
  <string id="12723">So what? Confiscate one from someone and bring it home. Just one! Martha needs vitamins, Carl!</string>
  <string id="12724">Martha has fluid in her lungs. The doctors at the hospital said she has only a couple of weeks to live, Carl!</string>
  <string id="12725">I brought Martha's medicine. I found Liebespirit! I brought her "the pure spirit," Anna!</string>
  <string id="12726">...he keeps talking about his girlfriend and freedom of speech.</string>
  <string id="12727">But that's his future. It could be better than ours. How much does he need?</string>
  <string id="12728">We couldn't save her, Carl! How will we live now? I'm scared, Carl, and lonely...</string>
  <string id="12729">I think the problem is he didn't make it to the geography class in his university yet...</string>
  <string id="12730">But they love each other! And he'll be better off abroad, I guess...</string>
  <string id="12731">The Ministry of Health has ordered the confiscation of all heaters.</string>
  <string id="12732">They were executed, Carl! And I heard the youngest one was sent to a labor camp...</string>
  <string id="12733">He said finding money for Martha's treatment was a heroic deed, and we managed to do it!</string>
  <string id="12734">Yes, he told me. He's really upset about having to give up his education.</string>
  <string id="12735">Working might make him grow up. And we could use the additional income.</string>
  <string id="12736">Do something, Carl! We need that money before it's too late!</string>
  <string id="12737">Take it. Perhaps you could sell it. Or maybe someone will come looking for it.</string>
  <string id="12738">Our baby will finally get well. I must give her the medicine at once!</string>
  <string id="12739">We also have to make sure she's well fed and warm.</string>
  <string id="12740">Do you think they'll let us have our boy back, Carl? Will I see him again?</string>
  <string id="12741">Why are you saying this? Do you want me to get a job?</string>
  <string id="12742">I'm afraid nothing can be done. At least for now. You know how it is…</string>
  <string id="12743">What's going on, Carl? Our son is threatening to issue a report!</string>
  <string id="12744">The letter blocks on the floor… I can't pick up her toys. I just can't...</string>
  <string id="12745">He asked me why we didn't have the Great Leader's portrait in our apartment.</string>
  <string id="12746">Sausages?! Is he insane? Are you sure that's what he said?</string>
  <string id="12747">I don't know, Carl. He really wants to study, but on the other hand...</string>
  <string id="12748">Or we'll have no water at all! Nothing for washing our hands or making soup...</string>
  <string id="12749">Really?! Carl, I'm sorry. I was wrong about you!</string>
  <string id="12750">Thank you, Carl. That's a lot of money to give away, but what choice do we have?</string>
  <string id="12751">I don't understand, Carl. Did our son go to the wrong country?!</string>
  <string id="12752">TALK ABOUT PATRICK'S GIRLFRIEND</string>
  <string id="12753">TALK ABOUT PATRICK</string>

  <string id="12768">I heard heating prices are expected to go up...</string>
  <string id="12769">Remember: I don't want crab apples. They're sour and full of bugs.</string>
  <string id="12770">I tried to talk him out of it but he won't listen...</string>
  <string id="12771">Of course I did. It wasn't easy to get.</string>
  <string id="12772">She can't have anymore sausages. It's best to give her porridge, soup, and fresh fruit.</string>
  <string id="12773">That's a big one! Enough to last a week! Martha will love it!</string>

  <string id="12784">What choice do I have? Dig up a cave in the woods?</string>
  <string id="12785">I understand. I'll think again.</string>

  <string id="12858">What do you want, Anna?</string>
  <string id="12859">What did the doctor say?</string>
  <string id="12860">It's up to you.</string>
  <string id="12861">What do you think?</string>
  <string id="12862">Did you get an apple?</string>
  <string id="12863">That changes everything!</string>
  <string id="12864">I told you!</string>
  <string id="12865">Okay, I will.</string>
  <string id="12866">Looks like it...</string>
  <string id="12867">GIVE THE APPLE</string>
  <string id="12868">Good news, Anna!</string>
  <string id="12870">Here.</string>
  <string id="12871">But what?</string>
  <string id="12872">Here.</string>

  <string id="13176">Thank you, honey.</string>
  <string id="14223">HOW MAY I HELP?</string>
  <string id="7157">That's right! It used to belong to my family. I wanted to turn it into a boarding house for gifted children, but it was converted into a residence hall instead.</string>
  <string id="7158">I went to the archives. They said there are no documents left. I spent a week in the line to see an inspector about submitting a detection application!</string>
  <string id="7161">But I can help you. I have books from when I worked for the Counting Bureau.</string>
  <string id="7163">It's over for you, bourgeois minion! I was told to evict you from the building! One wrong move, and you're on the street!</string>
  <string id="7164">Everyone should pursue a higher education. Too bad few people agree.</string>
  <string id="7165">Two months later, I was told I'd used the wrong form for my application. And they were out of the one I needed!</string>
  <string id="7166">The university gave my son a list of books to read, but none of the stores carry them. The library is an option, but the line is always really long.</string>
  <string id="7167">A boy in a paper hat will be waiting for you there. He spends his entire day wandering the streets. You'll recognize him.</string>
  <string id="7168">I used to play the piano and Maria sang. She has a charming voice.</string>
  <string id="7170">You'd better talk to my wife, Maria. I don't know anything about household issues or dishware.</string>
  <string id="7172">Yes, the documents are in the archive. They say it's a ploy to drive visitors crazy.</string>
  <string id="7175">Well, my problems shouldn't bother you. Thanks for the warning. What are you going to do?</string>
  <string id="7177">One can &lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#D53838FF&gt;play chess&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt; at liberty. This is expensive!</string>
  <string id="7178">My wife tried to buy train tickets, but they didn't sell them to her. It seems we've been blacklisted.</string>
  <string id="7179">They took my absentee certificate. Without it, I'm stuck here. You understand...</string>
  <string id="7181">I'm being hunted... It's hard to believe anyone is interested in my troubles.</string>
  <string id="7182">There's no way your kids can grow up and be happy here.</string>
  <string id="7184">If you can, Carl, take your family and leave.</string>
  <string id="7185">I'm ready to dig coal with my hands so Maria and I can leave this living hell!</string>
  <string id="7187">Alas, the best option is to get on a boat and sail away. This place is madness!</string>
  <string id="7189">Burn in hell! Your boss and you! I'll protect my apartment and my life!</string>
  <string id="7190">I'll try to think of something. At least it's a blacklist and not a list of people to be executed!</string>
  <string id="7191">I'm not asking out of curiosity; I want to help you.</string>
  <string id="7192">You work for the government, Carl. People expect you to be willing to do whatever it takes to get the job done.</string>
  <string id="7194">I refused to give them up and was accused of horrible things.</string>
  <string id="7195">You're right; our situation could be worse. At least we're free.</string>
  <string id="7198">You'll manage the building that used to belong to my family.</string>
  <string id="7199">My wife is upset. We've seen better days...</string>
  <string id="7200">We must find a way to leave the city and get as far away from it as we can.</string>
  <string id="7201">The ceilings are so low, I have to tilt my head...</string>
  <string id="7203">You're right; I have no time to talk about your problems.</string>
  <string id="7205">Take your absentee certificate. You're a free person now!</string>
  <string id="7206">I'll get right to the point... I've received an order to evict you from the building.</string>
  <string id="7208">Do you have a saucepan suitable for making a compote?</string>
  <string id="7211">Here are two tickets. All the info you need is on them. Now leave the country!</string>
  <string id="7212">I'm sorry, Klaus. I won't look for the instrument for you.</string>
  <string id="7213">You have a strange definition of helping. Go do your dirty work.</string>
  <string id="7214">It's always nasty. We don't see the sun for weeks.</string>
  <string id="7217">Maria was arrested. I don't understand how that could happen!</string>
  <string id="7218">I have no news regarding your papers. I'm still trying to obtain them.</string>
  <string id="7219">Unfortunately, all signs point to suicide...</string>
  <string id="7220">I want to help you. Why don't you leave the city?</string>
  <string id="7222">It's too expensive. I can't afford such losses.</string>
  <string id="7223">I'll contact you once my wife and I are safe!</string>
  <string id="7224">I used to work as a senior economist. Those days are long gone.</string>
  <string id="7225">This isn't so bad... You haven't seen the living quarters on level D!</string>
  <string id="7226">If I could, I would have left this poky hole a long time ago...</string>
  <string id="7227">I'd be happy if they helped your son study.</string>
  <string id="7228">It seems they got their way and kicked us out.</string>
  <string id="7230">Pack your things and go to the third pier.</string>
  <string id="7232">I've already given you the book. I don't have the second set.</string>
  <string id="7233">This system will reduce them to ashes and spit them out.</string>
  <string id="7234">Or even leave the country. Can you help?</string>
  <string id="7235">Hello! My name is Carl. I'm the new building manager.</string>
  <string id="7237">We have nothing to talk about. You're on the dark side, Carl.</string>
  <string id="7238">I started believing in people when I met you.</string>
  <string id="7239">I was told you spy on me. Is that true?</string>
  <string id="7240">Take this as a token of my gratitude, Carl.</string>
  <string id="7241">Take this. It's a gift for your daughter. I'll send you a message.</string>
  <string id="7242">Don't tell my wife how bad things are...</string>
  <string id="7243">The previous manager had already turned it into junk.</string>
  <string id="7244">I have no time for this nonsense.</string>
  <string id="7246">Oh, the issue with the library is well-known to me!</string>
  <string id="7247">I still can't believe you've decided to help us.</string>
  <string id="7248">That would be nice of you. I really want to play!</string>
  <string id="7249">It reminds me of our existence. What about you?</string>
  <string id="7250">I'll never violate our neighbors' peace and quiet!</string>
  <string id="7251">You should know such things, Carl.</string>
  <string id="7252">I'm not going to buy an instrument for you.</string>
  <string id="7253">I want to surprise her and make her happy.</string>
  <string id="7254">You can't evict me without reason!</string>
  <string id="7256">You must be more careful, comrade Klaus.</string>
  <string id="7257">It was silly to hope for any other ending.</string>
  <string id="7258">Ah, if only you could find a piano for us!</string>
  <string id="7259">You must respect the peace and quiet of the other tenants.</string>
  <string id="7260">Incredible! You did it!</string>
  <string id="7261">You saved my son! Thank you, Klaus.</string>
  <string id="7262">My life is over. Poor Maria.</string>
  <string id="7263">I need money, Klaus.</string>
  <string id="7264">Have you thought about how to leave the city?</string>
  <string id="7265">I don't have a piano for you yet.</string>
  <string id="7266">Yes, I've found a piano for you.</string>
  <string id="7267">You mean the documents are lost in the archives?</string>
  <string id="7268">SAY THE BOSUN WILL HELP WITH THE ESCAPE</string>
  <string id="7269">Now nothing will prevent you from leaving.</string>
  <string id="7270">She doesn't know they nailed us.</string>
  <string id="7271">Run! Anywhere! Any way!</string>
  <string id="7272">And not only my son, but my wallet, too.</string>
  <string id="7273">Shere? That's an international port...</string>
  <string id="7274">Can you do me a favor?</string>
  <string id="7275">I'd be very grateful to you!</string>
  <string id="7276">TELL ABOUT THE MINISTRY ORDER</string>
  <string id="7277">Do you want to evict me? It's your right.</string>
  <string id="7278">ASK ABOUT ESCAPING THE CITY</string>

  <string id="7286">Do you want to talk with me?</string>
  <string id="7287">We have nothing to talk about.</string>
  <string id="7288">TALK ABOUT THE CRUISE TICKETS</string>
  <string id="7289">Absolutely. I already have some sheet music.</string>
  <string id="7290">I don't know if that's a joke or not.</string>
  <string id="7291">My gratitude knows no bounds.</string>
  <string id="7292">What's your problem, Klaus?</string>
  <string id="7293">I'll think about what I can do for you.</string>
  <string id="7294">What's an absentee certificate?</string>
  <string id="7295">I hope you can fix this.</string>
  <string id="7296">Now go to hell!</string>
  <string id="7297">Do you still need the instrument?</string>
  <string id="7298">Did the house belong to you?</string>

  <string id="7332">GIVE THE PIANO</string>
  <string id="7333">As I thought.</string>
  <string id="7334">GET ACQUAINTED</string>
  <string id="7335">Hello!</string>
  <string id="7337">Damn it!</string>
  <string id="7338">CONFIRM</string>
  <string id="7339">What happened?</string>
  <string id="7340">EXCUSE YOURSELF</string>
  <string id="7341">Nonsense!</string>
  <string id="7342">Weather?</string>
  <string id="8833">Sorry, but I pay very little attention to the people around me.</string>
  <string id="8835">TALK ABOUT SARAH WATTERMACH</string>
  <string id="9083">It's nice to meet you!</string>
  <string id="9873">I received a response from the Ministry: the documents were sent to the archives for the data update. They said I could obtain them there.</string>
  <string id="9874">I was sent to the tobacco shop, to that tiny wooden booth near the fish market.</string>
  <string id="9875">It's not just the line; the library workers also have to like you. Otherwise, they'll send you away without any explanation.</string>
  <string id="9876">My nerves are frayed. If you don't stop threatening me, Carl, I swear I'll shoot you!</string>
  <string id="9877">This is the document you need to either enter the strategic facilities or leave the city.</string>
  <string id="9878">I agreed with the bosun, John Popanedo. He'll take you with him on a trip. They're sailing to Shere!</string>
  <string id="9879">I beg your pardon, but I have to return to work. Maybe we can continue this conversation later.</string>
  <string id="9881">I'll probably be accused of selling antigovernment tobacco!</string>
  <string id="9882">The Ministry of Distribution has clean hands. There's nothing we can do about the archives.</string>
  <string id="9883">Pack your things and leave this house on good terms.</string>
  <string id="9884">You're an educated person, Klaus. Where can I find textbooks on economics?</string>
  <string id="9885">The conditions won't be perfect; it's a coal barge. But you'll manage!</string>
  <string id="9886">Yes. I have to leave the apartment, Carl. We're out of money and...</string>
  <string id="9887">My gratitude knows no bounds. Give this to your daughter!</string>
  <string id="9888">Take this money! I hope it'll cover at least some of your expenses.</string>
  <string id="9889">Hello, Carl! I'm losing more and more hope with every new day.</string>
  <string id="9890">Railway stations, ports, and roads with checkpoints are all closed to me.</string>
  <string id="9891">Let's see what I can do about your absentee certificate.</string>
  <string id="9892">What? THEY want to evict me from my apartment? That's unthinkable!</string>
  <string id="9893">This is suspicious, Carl. Why would you care about me?</string>
  <string id="9894">My gratitude knows no bounds. You saved our lives!</string>
  <string id="9895">It seems you're feeling down. Let's finish our talk.</string>
  <string id="9896">I want to talk about your neighbor's new girlfriend.</string>
  <string id="9897">I have to work in a tobacco shop now.</string>
  <string id="9898">I already told you. Don't you remember?</string>
  <string id="9899">Are you mixed up with something?</string>
  <string id="9900">You're anti-state...</string>
  <string id="9901">I'm afraid it's not good…</string>
  <string id="9902">"MUSIC WILL NEVER DIE"</string>
  <string id="9903">It's all about the apartment.</string>
  <string id="9904">I'll do my best.</string>
  <string id="14224">Tell me straight, Carl: Did you receive an assignment to spy on me?</string>
  <string id="14639">FURNITURE REPAIR</string>
  <string id="14640">I'm here on business. I need to repair the furniture in your apartment.</string>
  <string id="14641">Come in!</string>
  <string id="7343">Why did mom say that? I heard she said you have to buy perfume for her first and then everything else.</string>
  <string id="7344">Martha, Mr. Klaus and his wife left today. They went on a cruise!</string>
  <string id="7347">She said she's never eaten anything like this before! I'm waiting for you to buy them.</string>
  <string id="7350">Naira will be a miner buried under rubble, and I'll be the rescuer!</string>
  <string id="7351">Moreover, we have a TV! Will they take our TV, dad?</string>
  <string id="7353">I ate two and Naira ate one. Together, we ate three pieces of candy!</string>
  <string id="7354">Why doesn't Patrick like dentists?</string>
  <string id="7357">Tell me who took the glasses. Now! This is serious!</string>
  <string id="7358">But you'll buy me some aspirin, and I'll be healthy again!</string>
  <string id="7359">Mr. Klaus from apartment 1 gave it to you. Here it is!</string>
  <string id="7361">I'm glad you haven't eaten any of these. Most sweets are bad for you.</string>
  <string id="7362">He cleaned them with his sleeve, tried one, and then put them in his pocket.</string>
  <string id="7363">Of course I'll find it! Your dad can find anything!</string>
  <string id="7365">It's my favorite doll, dad! Will you help me find it?</string>
  <string id="7367">Yes! You bought some very tasty sweets, dad!</string>
  <string id="7371">Is it true that nothing hurts as much as this?</string>
  <string id="7372">Mommy will give me one each time I have tea.</string>
  <string id="7374">He said kids are worse than bugs...</string>
  <string id="7375">I miss Naira so much! Will you find her?</string>
  <string id="7376">Have you seen Mark Ranek's glasses, Martha?</string>
  <string id="7377">Let's go thank him.</string>
  <string id="7379">I wanted to eat more, but mom didn't let me.</string>
  <string id="7380">I like him very much! He's big! And you?</string>
  <string id="7381">I'll buy some candy and bring it to you.</string>
  <string id="7382">You won't tell him off, will you, dad?</string>
  <string id="7383">How are you, honey?</string>
  <string id="7384">Then I'll tell who found the glasses!</string>
  <string id="7385">Don't cry, dear. What man?</string>
  <string id="7386">The nasty man in apartment 2!</string>
  <string id="7387">I've brought you something, love!</string>
  <string id="7388">Do you like our new home?</string>
  <string id="7389">Sure, honey. I promise!</string>
  <string id="7391">I'll build a coal mine out of letter blocks.</string>
  <string id="7392">I'll buy you sweets just because!</string>
  <string id="7393">Will we go to the sea, dad?</string>
  <string id="7394">I already found her. Here she is!</string>
  <string id="7395">I've been dreaming about having a bear like this!</string>
  <string id="7397">Patrick taught me how to count.</string>
  <string id="7398">What's your doll's name?</string>
  <string id="7399">I'll deal with him, Martha.</string>
  <string id="7400">ASK HOW THEY FEEL</string>
  <string id="7402">Did mom give you candy?</string>
  <string id="7403">No, honey. Nobody will take it.</string>
  <string id="7404">GIVE THE TEDDY BEAR AWAY</string>
  <string id="7405">I want candy, daddy.</string>
  <string id="7406">I see... Patrick...</string>
  <string id="7407">Here's your candy, love!</string>
  <string id="7408">What happened, sweetheart?</string>
  <string id="7409">I like him, too.</string>
  <string id="7410">LEARN ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED</string>
  <string id="7411">TALK ABOUT THE DOLL</string>
  <string id="7413">ASK ABOUT THE CANDY</string>
  <string id="7416">Will you play with me?</string>
  <string id="7417">END CONVERSATION</string>
  <string id="7418">Thanks, dad!</string>
  <string id="7419">Not now, Martha.</string>
  <string id="7420">ASK ABOUT THE GLASSES</string>
  <string id="7421">Who's Naira?</string>
  <string id="7422">ASK ABOUT THE HOUSE</string>
  <string id="7423">It's my doll!</string>
  <string id="7424">I lost Naira!</string>
  <string id="7425">OFFER THE CANDY</string>
  <string id="7426">AGREE</string>
  <string id="7427">Let it be so!</string>
  <string id="7428">Who is it?</string>
  <string id="7429">SHOUT</string>
  <string id="7430">And he...</string>
  <string id="9559">Thank you, dad! I'll play the doctor! Mom doesn't let me play with a ball. I always start coughing up blood...</string>
  <string id="9560">The man in the hat wanted to know who lives with us. I told him about the bear, Naira, and my rabbit. He laughed when I told him my bunny had no ears.</string>
  <string id="9561">Let's pretend to be secret agents and not tell anyone about the bearded man, OK?</string>
  <string id="9562">And don't tell anyone we're secret agents, either. Martha!</string>
  <string id="9563">I'll cure my rabbit. Doctors can't help him, just like they can't help me.</string>
  <string id="9564">Can you bring me a first-aid kit? I want to cure my rabbit. He's sick like me!</string>
  <string id="9565">Did you meet the bearded man who lives in my office?</string>
  <string id="9566">I'll find a first-aid kit for you. I promise! We'll cure you!</string>
  <string id="9567">I've been a secret agent longer than you! And I haven't said anything!</string>
  <string id="9568">I'll bring you one. I promise! You're such a nice girl!</string>
  <string id="9569">Here's the first-aid kit, darling. Now cure your rabbit!</string>
  <string id="9570">Bring me a first-aid kit, daddy.</string>
  <string id="9571">Hurray! You're finally going to play with me!</string>
  <string id="9572">Let's play a game, darling. Ready?</string>
  <string id="9573">TALK ABOUT THE MAN IN YOUR APARTMENT</string>
  <string id="9574">I haven't said anything about anyone...</string>
  <string id="9575">Who was asking you?</string>
  <string id="9576">GIVE THE FIRST-AID KIT TO MARTHA</string>
  <string id="9577">FIRST-AID KIT FOR MARTHA</string>
  <string id="9578">Yes, daddy.</string>
  <string id="9905">When Patrick was a little boy, his teeth hurt all the time, and he had to fix them.</string>
  <string id="9906">At home. Naira is too small to walk outside. Find her! Please.</string>
  <string id="9907">No, it wasn't me, but if you give me some candy, I'll tell you who it was.</string>
  <string id="9908">I saw Patrick take the glasses from under the table in the kitchen.</string>
  <string id="9909">Trading is bad, honey. Just let me know who you saw.</string>
  <string id="9910">Mom said my teeth would hurt, and we'd have to go to a dentist.</string>
  <string id="9911">What a game! Maybe you'd better play with your letter blocks...</string>
  <string id="9912">I don't want sweets. I have a fever.</string>
  <string id="9913">Patrick says they sometimes show a cartoon.</string>
  <string id="9914">You scared me, Martha. Where did you last play with it?</string>
  <string id="9915">No, it's not true. Don't listen to Patrick.</string>
  <string id="9916">We have three rooms! We used to have just one.</string>
  <string id="9917">I thought of a great game. Want me to tell you about it?</string>
  <string id="9918">The old man who lives on the second floor...</string>
  <string id="9919">Your mom asked me to buy you some sweets.</string>
  <string id="9920">Mom says I feel sick.</string>
  <string id="9921">Something bad happened, dad...</string>
  <string id="9922">I was walking down the stairs...</string>
  <string id="9923">"LOST TOY"</string>
  <string id="9924">And that man pushed me!</string>
  <string id="9925">It's nowhere to be found.</string>
  <string id="11898">There's no such place, daddy! Mom says there are factories everywhere and the sky is gray.</string>
  <string id="11899">There are factories everywhere! Otherwise, people would have no place to work, and everyone would starve to death.</string>
  <string id="11900">Sweetie, those factories make machines and guns, not groceries.</string>
  <string id="11901">We'll go on a trip and see for ourselves, baby, OK?</string>
  <string id="11902">We'll go to a place with a clear, blue sky and a brightly shining sun!</string>
  <string id="11903">But we need weapons to do battle and take food!</string>
  <string id="11904">Martha, darling, would you like to go on a trip?</string>
  <string id="11905">But don't tell anyone, OK?</string>
  <string id="11906">Sure! Where are we going?</string>
  <string id="11907">TELL ABOUT THE TRIP</string>
  <string id="11908">Okay, daddy.</string>
  <string id="12901">Mom and I went to the hospital, and one old lady said she couldn't wait for her old man to be put in the ground.</string>
  <string id="12902">Okay, daddy, but nobody has talked to me since I pretended to be a dog and barked at everyone.</string>
  <string id="12903">I want to draw him a sun and a rainbow! But I have only black paint left...</string>
  <string id="12904">I don't understand... Why didn't the wolf eat all of the piglets at once? He's strong, like you!</string>
  <string id="12905">That's great! So Patrick wasn't the one killed in the explosion. I've nearly cried my eyes out!</string>
  <string id="12906">Go read a book, Martha. You need to study. You're going to school next year!</string>
  <string id="12907">She was alive not long ago, and said, "Don't break the mug, silly!"</string>
  <string id="12908">I had that dream about the guy who's on the banner taking away my air so I can't breathe.</string>
  <string id="12909">And she said he needs to die because she's fed up with him.</string>
  <string id="12910">Martha, Patrick went far, far away. Don't tell anyone.</string>
  <string id="12911">I heard the machine by the building reading fairy tales! That was cool!</string>
  <string id="12912">Patrick went far away, dear. But he said hi.</string>
  <string id="12913">Patrick is in the hospital, sweetheart, but he'll be back.</string>
  <string id="12914">Daddy, when people run out of space for the dead, what will they do with the bodies? Pile them in the streets?</string>
  <string id="12915">Daddy, is it true that when people die, they're buried in the ground?</string>
  <string id="12916">No, of course not. Your brother is fine.</string>
  <string id="12918">Mom keeps crying... Can you make her stop?</string>
  <string id="12919">I asked why they put him in the ground. Is he a miner?</string>
  <string id="12920">How are you doing, Martha? Did Mom give you medicine?</string>
  <string id="12921">I can't breathe, and he laughs, and then I start coughing again...</string>
  <string id="12922">It's like the sun is in my lungs. Cool, huh?</string>
  <string id="12923">I could play with Naira and not fall even once today!</string>
  <string id="12924">Then how come we don't have enough land to grow food?</string>
  <string id="12925">TALK ABOUT HEALTH</string>
  <string id="12926">Why is Mom crying again? I'm getting better.</string>
  <string id="12927">It hurts in my chest... It hurts a lot!</string>
  <string id="12928">I understand, Martha. It's hard for all of us.</string>
  <string id="12929">Mom gave me some syrup, dad. It was yummy!</string>
  <string id="12931">I have nightmares a lot, daddy.</string>
  <string id="12932">Where was your mother, Martha?</string>
  <string id="12935">The one from the hallway banner.</string>
  <string id="12936">What happened to Patrick, daddy?</string>
  <string id="12937">TALK ABOUT PATRICK</string>
  <string id="12938">Yes, sweetie. Did you like the story?</string>
  <string id="12939">No, baby, there's enough room for everyone...</string>
  <string id="12940">Tell everyone he went to the capital.</string>
  <string id="12941">How are you doing, Martha?</string>
  <string id="12942">How is that possible, daddy?</string>
  <string id="12943">But mom will always be with you.</string>
  <string id="12944">TALK ABOUT MOTHER'S DEATH</string>
  <string id="12945">Yes, she gave me pills.</string>
  <string id="12946">Those are tears of happiness, baby.</string>
  <string id="12947">What makes you think so, Martha?</string>
  <string id="12949">Not too well, dad.</string>
  <string id="12950">I'll draw a black sun!</string>
  <string id="12951">That's true, Martha.</string>
  <string id="12952">TALK ABOUT THE STORY</string>
  <string id="12953">Martha, Mom died...</string>
  <string id="12954">What guy, Martha?</string>
  <string id="12955">She was waiting in line.</string>
  <string id="12956">AVOID ANSWERING</string>
  <string id="12957">Did you do that?</string>
  <string id="12958">And I did break it...</string>
  <string id="12959">Yes, sweetie...</string>
  <string id="12960">CONFIRM</string>
  <string id="14247">This cough syrup is sweet, baby. Trust me; it tastes great!</string>
  <string id="14248">It's a pill, sweetheart. It doesn't taste like anything. Don't be afraid!</string>
  <string id="14249">Martha, you need to take this medicine.</string>
  <string id="14250">Of course it will, kiddo.</string>
  <string id="14251">Will it make me better, Daddy?</string>
  <string id="14252">GIVE MEDICINE</string>
  <string id="14253">Is it bitter? The last one I took was so bitter, I had to chew a sugar cube afterwards.</string>
  <string id="7433">People say the quotas for higher education are being reduced. The most popular department is mining.</string>
  <string id="7436">You're a liar! My wife and I searched every nook and cranny! Your place is filthy, though... I wonder if your wife has ever cleaned those nooks and crannies!</string>
  <string id="7438">Deal, but you owe me a bottle of whiskey. I won't be able to access the confiscated documents without it.</string>
  <string id="7439">Ah, young people... They're in such a hurry to grow up. They don't think about going bald and getting fat.</string>
  <string id="7440">Remember, I'm not doing this for YOU but to protect the reputation of the archives! Losing even a single document would be bad!</string>
  <string id="7441">What's wrong with the library? It's quiet in there. It's a nice place for a young man to spend time!</string>
  <string id="7442">Don't forget you're talking to an apartment manager, old man. Give me the documents for Schimmer.</string>
  <string id="7443">I lost my glasses, Carl, and I can't work in the archives without them.</string>
  <string id="7444">Yesterday, someone at the archives said the railway that crosses the northern border is blocked.</string>
  <string id="7445">My wife usually cooks soup, but to be honest, her saucepan is rather small.</string>
  <string id="7448">I need your help. One good man can't obtain a document from the archives...</string>
  <string id="7449">What risk are you talking about? Find one lost document - an absentee certificate.</string>
  <string id="7450">Do you have a dignified lady for the doctor in apartment 2?</string>
  <string id="7451">I had a co-worker who was always poking his nose into other people's business... and documents...</string>
  <string id="7454">The university gave my son a list of books to study, but none of the stores carry them.</string>
  <string id="7456">He works in the tobacco shop but has never given me tobacco for free!</string>
  <string id="7457">The glass is stained! People these days are nasty... Not like when I was young...</string>
  <string id="7458">They're just ordinary glasses, but I can't buy a pair without a prescription.</string>
  <string id="7460">If anything happens, you won't give me a penny for food!</string>
  <string id="7462">What do you take me for? Pfft! Do you think this is a brothel?</string>
  <string id="7464">Do you have a big saucepan? My wife wants to make a compote.</string>
  <string id="7465">Rosa will go there tomorrow and take the provision card to the doctor.</string>
  <string id="7468">Everyone should open their doors and bow to you!</string>
  <string id="7470">The flow of documents into the archives has tripled!</string>
  <string id="7471">What risk are you talking about? You're a respected archivist!</string>
  <string id="7472">You can always call the police. Give me more time.</string>
  <string id="7473">I don't know anything you don't know.</string>
  <string id="7474">Thanks, but I doubt my son appreciates your advice.</string>
  <string id="7475">Fix the chair. End of the story.</string>
  <string id="7476">My son took them. He wanted to look smart at the university.</string>

  <string id="7482">The documents of good people aren't taken to the archives...</string>
  <string id="7483">You're the one in a hurry, not me!</string>
  <string id="7484">Help me! Bring me his absentee certificate.</string>

  <string id="7494">Go ahead! Go... Young people always have a lot to do.</string>
  <string id="7495">I thought he bought it for himself!</string>
  <string id="7497">Be grateful I'm not asking you for $2,000!</string>
  <string id="7498">Not so fast! That's a lot of money...</string>
  <string id="7499">I have to live in this disgusting apartment.</string>
  <string id="7500">What do you want? Get out of my way!</string>
  <string id="7501">You bring me the whiskey, and I'll bring you the documents.</string>

  <string id="7503">Thanks, Mark! You've been a big help.</string>
  <string id="7504">The library is an option, but there's always a line.</string>

  <string id="9117">We've met before! Don't you remember me?</string>
  <string id="9926">I'm talking about Schimmer from apartment 1. He fell from grace with the State. They took his absentee certificate, and now he's stuck here.</string>
  <string id="9927">Yes, he's been sent to the Mining College, but we managed to secure a place in the university for him.</string>
  <string id="9928">Mr. Mark, you're an educated person. Where can I find textbooks on economics?</string>
  <string id="9929">&lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#D53838FF&gt;She loves baking buns and cakes so much&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, she does it for a living.</string>
  <string id="9930">So she says, "Who needs the old wench? Marry me, and we'll be happy!"</string>

  <string id="7588">It seems she doesn't like me. I've been waiting for my book for two hours, and it was on the shelf all this time. I saw it!</string>
  <string id="7590">She likes going to the theatre. I heard she wants to go to opening night. This is my chance, father!</string>
  <string id="7591">I really don't want to go there! The woman who works there is nasty to people. She hisses at everyone.</string>
  <string id="7593">Can you ask your friends? Perhaps someone you know has these books.</string>
  <string id="7594">Going to the theatre is pointless! Invite her to walk along the river and buy her something sweet.</string>
  <string id="7595">To be honest, I didn't think you could secure a place in the university for me!</string>
  <string id="7596">Don't forget to wash up before your date. One shouldn't go to the theatre with a dirty neck!</string>
  <string id="7597">Be a diligent student, son! That place costs A LOT...</string>

  <string id="10933">No, Patrick, I won't give you any money. You have a decent and well-paying job, so stop complaining.</string>
  <string id="10934">Here. It took a lot out of me to get that much. I hope you won't fail me.</string>

  <string id="10936">You're leaving me with no choice, son. Come to your senses! Your juvenile brain won't let you see the whole picture.</string>
  <string id="10937">We'll see what we can do. Worst case scenario, you'll get a job. The country needs miners.</string>
  <string id="10938">Poor little miner... Too bad they didn't teach you geography at the university…</string>
  <string id="10939">The same profile I had at the university. I'll be able to graduate and get a good job there.</string>
  <string id="10940">Yes, dad, the dean has ordered us to take part in another fundraiser. It's a lot of money, and I have no idea where to get it...</string>
  <string id="10942">Maybe you should take a break abroad. Loosen up a bit, change your mind, and then come back.</string>
  <string id="10943">One of my coworkers told me they need my profile experts in North Borea.</string>
  <string id="10944">I don't know how to help you. Perhaps you'll be able to go to your girl in future…</string>
  <string id="10945">Hi, dad. We need to talk. I'm thinking of leaving the country with my girlfriend.</string>
  <string id="10946">I can feel myself becoming dumber every day. And there's no way I'll ever get out of this!</string>
  <string id="10947">Hi, dad. Can you help me? You know I don't want to be a miner…</string>
  <string id="10948">Just let us know when you get there.</string>
  <string id="10949">Her family needs to leave ASAP. And I should go with them! She means the world to me!</string>
  <string id="10950">You betrayed me! So I'll rob a bank and leave! Damn that town!</string>

  <string id="10952">$[$balance_son_trip]?! Do I look like the Minister of Finance to you? Where am I supposed to get that kind of money?</string>
  <string id="10953">I'll never have that much money! This education isn't worth it.</string>
  <string id="10957">WHAT?!! Are they crazy? Our people don't have that kind of money!</string>
  <string id="10958">That's the cruise. You can go whenever you want. And it's up to you to decide if you want to disembark in another country.</string>
  <string id="10959">How could you do this?! And you want me to be grateful?</string>
  <string id="10960">Dad, I don't want to cause you any trouble... If you can't find the money...</string>
  <string id="10961">Oh, no! My poor sister! How can we live without her? How is this even possible?! I...</string>
  <string id="10962">Okay, let's deal with the issues in the order of their appearance. How much time do I have?</string>
  <string id="10965">Wow! Thanks, dad! You have no idea what this means to me!</string>
  <string id="10966">Go away, and stop whining. We still don't know what's going to happen to Martha.</string>
  <string id="10967">Martha is sick, Patrick. We need a lot of money to save her.</string>
  <string id="10968">Remember to take a big bag with you. You know - for the loot.</string>
  <string id="10969">Thanks, dad! You're the best! I won't fail you. I promise!</string>
  <string id="10970">I'll be forever grateful to you, dad. You saved me from a horrible job!</string>
  <string id="10971">He has nothing to do with this, dad. I swear! His enemies have been filing false complaints about him for years!</string>
  <string id="10972">Her father… He's been stalked for years. And he's innocent. I swear!</string>
  <string id="10974">I can't bear it anymore, dad! Another day in the mine, and I'll hang myself!</string>
  <string id="10975">Wow! Who is she?! Why do you need to leave the country?</string>
  <string id="10977">Hold on, dad. I don't even know where to start.</string>
  <string id="10978">I don't care! I hate our government and its stupid directives!</string>
  <string id="10979">Is she pregnant? Do you realize it's hard to leave the country at the moment?</string>
  <string id="10980">I want to leave the country, dad… If I stay here, I'll eventually cease to be human.</string>
  <string id="10981">Do you understand the position you put me in? What should I do now?!</string>
  <string id="10982">How much do you need? We still need money to cure Martha, you know.</string>
  <string id="10983">Hold on, son. Perhaps she's better off wherever she is now...</string>
  <string id="10984">I don't know what to say, son. We couldn't save Martha. I couldn't...</string>
  <string id="10985">Print? $[$balance_son_trip]! I hadn't even seen that much money at your age!</string>
  <string id="10987">But you should come to your senses and stop that rebellious nonsense.</string>
  <string id="10988">I can't give you any money. I simply don't have that much, and most likely never will.</string>
  <string id="10989">Aren't you too young to make decisions that could change your whole life?</string>
  <string id="10990">Dad! You met mom when you were only a year older than me!</string>
  <string id="10991">A time might come when we need more and more money.</string>
  <string id="10992">Please Let us know you're OK, alright?</string>
  <string id="10993">Leave me alone, ministry lap-dog! Do what you must.</string>
  <string id="10994">When I was your age, I was turning soil over with a stick, and it was fun!</string>
  <string id="10995">People must be free. The revolutionists will eventually take over!</string>
  <string id="10996">And what don't I see? You churning out reports on people?</string>
  <string id="10997">And we don't know how much Martha's treatment will cost.</string>
  <string id="10998">You turned in someone else instead?! You're a scumbag!</string>
  <string id="10999">All is lost! What should I do? I can't live without her!</string>
  <string id="11000">If things continue to go like this, we'll have no one left to teach...</string>
  <string id="11001">They found out something threatening has been uncovered.</string>
  <string id="11002">Oh... You'll break your mother's heart if you leave…</string>
  <string id="11003">Two days - or they'll leave without me.</string>
  <string id="11004">Geez! OK... I need time to think.</string>
  <string id="11005">So what? You'll get a job.</string>
  <string id="11006">Yes! And we dated for three years before getting married!</string>
  <string id="11007">Thank you, dad. I'll never forget this! Yahoo!!!</string>
  <string id="11008">That's a lot of money, son, and it won't be easy to come by.</string>
  <string id="11009">You'll be in jail for the rest of your life!</string>
  <string id="11010">I did what I had to do to protect my son.</string>
  <string id="11011">You never asked, I never said. She's a professor's daughter.</string>
  <string id="11012">Don't worry. The Ministry won't touch you.</string>
  <string id="11013">GIVE THE TICKETS</string>
  <string id="11014">Stop yelling! I won't give you the money, but I will give you tickets.</string>
  <string id="11015">I'm sorry, Patrick, but we don't have that much money.</string>
  <string id="11016">And who knows how long it will take?</string>
  <string id="11017">Though perhaps that's the intent...</string>
  <string id="11018">If she's still waiting for you...</string>
  <string id="11019">Here, son - a present from your Rockefeller dad.</string>
  <string id="11020">And what's the reason for the sudden departure?</string>
  <string id="11021">I can't talk right now... It's too hard...</string>
  <string id="11022">North and South Borea are two different planets.</string>
  <string id="11023">I hope that will help you find happiness.</string>
  <string id="11024">Why are you telling me only now?</string>
  <string id="11025">So, dad, could you get the money?</string>
  <string id="11026">Patrick, your sister died... Martha passed away...</string>
  <string id="11027">What?! How is that possible?! Mom?! No!!!</string>
  <string id="11028">Here, son, anything for you...</string>
  <string id="11029">North? Are you sure it's not South Borea?</string>
  <string id="11030">Are you in trouble at the university, son?</string>
  <string id="11031">You saw what those mines do to people!</string>
  <string id="11032">I don't know what I'm going to do... What should I do?</string>
  <string id="11033">Every teenage love lasts forever.</string>
  <string id="11034">No, son, I don't have enough yet.</string>
  <string id="11036">Nothing will be OK, Dad. Nothing...</string>
  <string id="11038">And I'll never see my love again.</string>
  <string id="11039">Patrick, I can't give you the money...</string>
  <string id="11040">She's always wanted to go on a cruise!</string>
  <string id="11041">Wait, son, I don't have enough yet...</string>
  <string id="11042">Anywhere is better than here!</string>
  <string id="11044">Your mother died, Patrick.</string>
  <string id="11045">I have something better...</string>
  <string id="11046">I've never even seen that much money at one time!</string>
  <string id="11047">And we need money for Martha.</string>
  <string id="11048">Calm down, Patrick. Everything will be fine.</string>
  <string id="11049">Are you in trouble with the law?</string>
  <string id="11051">That means he's a criminal!</string>

  <string id="13041">I'm positive. He considered me his property. And he's really touchy when it comes to his stuff.</string>
  <string id="13042">You were right; life got better. But it would be even better still if this jerk leaves me alone.</string>
  <string id="13043">My parents forced me to. Their, uh, goal in life was to make sure their daughter was, uh, taken care of.</string>
  <string id="13044">I'm afraid he'll find out I'm here. And then he'll come and break me, like a doll.</string>
  <string id="13045">For him, that was just a scratch that healed in a week. But he battered me, almost every day, for six months.</string>
  <string id="13046">If constant doctor visits due to battering is considered being mistreated, then yes.</string>
  <string id="13047">It took me several years to build up the courage to escape, but I finally did it. And I'm now in hiding.</string>
  <string id="13048">No. The worst part was that every time I was hospitalized with yet another broken bone, they took his side.</string>
  <string id="13049">Moreover, he's been having trouble at work because he's now terrified of firearms!</string>
  <string id="13050">Well, Carl, I need a gun. It's the only way I can defend myself against my crazy ex-husband…</string>
  <string id="13051">Here! Thanks to you, I finally feel safe!</string>
  <string id="13052">All because he dropped a loaded rifle once and shot himself in the butt.</string>
  <string id="13053">Just kidding. After I started taking a sleeping aid, I could finally get enough rest and even laugh again.</string>
  <string id="13054">I'm certain that won't be a problem for you, Carl. Will you save me?</string>
  <string id="13055">You have no idea what you did for me! You risked your reputation!</string>
  <string id="13056">You'll see what a difference a good night's rest can make!</string>
  <string id="13057">The thing is, I'm terrified of my ex-husband. He's an awful man, Carl.</string>
  <string id="13058">Oh, Carl! You should've thought about that before giving me a gun!</string>
  <string id="13059">As soon as I close my eyes, I start thinking of terrible things...</string>
  <string id="13060">At the rifle factory, they call him Holy Ass.</string>
  <string id="13061">I need to run away. Too bad you couldn't get a gun for me.</string>
  <string id="13062">The problem is, he knows people from the Ministry of Migration.</string>
  <string id="13063">I wouldn't have asked you if it was simple. I'll pay you, Carl!</string>
  <string id="13064">I remember, Dora. But guns are prohibited. I can't promise you anything.</string>
  <string id="13065">My ex-husband was only brave with me.</string>
  <string id="13066">Are you serious? Possessing firearms is illegal!</string>
  <string id="13067">Yes, I found you a sleeping aid. It should help.</string>

  <string id="14647">Come in!</string>
  <string id="7736">Do you have a large saucepan, miss? My wife left hers at our old house, and our daughter is asking for compote.</string>
  <string id="7737">Of course! The ones we have are bad... Just bones and water... Yours will sell like hot cakes in our dining hall!</string>

  <string id="7795">Good afternoon!</string>
  <string id="7796">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="8434">It was delicious! The old man ate so much, he had a hard time sleeping. He kept talking about sandwiches and fish jelly in his sleep.</string>
  <string id="8437">You're a state worker, Carl. You have got papers, directives, and a big, red phone.</string>
  <string id="8438">He's suffering from indigestion. You know how it is with groceries nowadays.</string>
  <string id="8439">He says that bubblehead from apartment 2 caught him by the fridge and started hitting him.</string>

  <string id="8442">That's nice. Where was I? Oh, right. She's not my niece.</string>
  <string id="8443">Her guests ate the pies I brought from the dining hall yesterday.</string>
  <string id="8445">Okay, one pack of strong black tea would be an even trade.</string>

  <string id="8452">My old man looked for them for two hours straight, then got on to me.</string>

  <string id="10027">As a state representative, I should support the creation of a new social unit.</string>
  <string id="10028">They kept the matter quiet. It turned out that it was more than canned food. The herring was rotten, too.</string>

  <string id="10030">What a couple they could be! They could have kids and live happily ever after...</string>

  <string id="10033">Can't you call someone and find out?</string>
  <string id="10034">I had only one veil, and I already gave it to you.</string>
  <string id="10035">I hope my husband doesn't take the pills before you return.</string>
  <string id="10036">He helped me to acquire a nice bottle of Xeres.</string>

  <string id="8563">Hi, handsome!</string>
  <string id="8564">Alloisius left...</string>
  <string id="8565">Ciao!</string>
  <string id="8836">You have no idea how great it feels to wake up and have a glass of wine in bed.</string>
  <string id="8838">Couldn't be better, Carl. I have fun at home all day long.</string>
  <string id="8839">How are you doing, Clara?</string>
  <string id="8840">CHAT</string>
  <string id="8858">EVICT CLARA</string>
  <string id="9060">Last time, I danced so hard, I broke both heels and a couple of tables! Good times...</string>
  <string id="9061">Find me a bottle of something strong, will you? I'll pay you well.</string>
  <string id="9062">This wine isn't nearly as good as what Alloisius has in his collection.</string>
  <string id="9064">You see right through me, dear Carl!</string>
  <string id="9065">But, alas, it's over...</string>
  <string id="9067">You asked for alcohol...</string>
  <string id="9068">What did you bring?</string>
  <string id="9069">I'm bored...</string>
  <string id="9070">GIVE ALCOHOL TO CLARA</string>

  <string id="9072">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="9073">Whiskey? Okay.</string>
  <string id="9074">GIVE WHISKEY</string>
  <string id="9075">GIVE WINE</string>
  <string id="9076">GIVE RUM</string>
  <string id="9118">I'll pay you. Take the money and leave, and let Alloisius be.</string>
  <string id="9119">No way! Alloisius promised to take me away on a boat!</string>
  <string id="10062">Why should I? I like it here, and I'm not going to follow the instructions of some petty tyrant like you!</string>
  <string id="10063">He showed me the pictures and said he's keeping them as a souvenir. They should be mine!</string>
  <string id="10064">I'm all alone in this city. And I gave my best years to that croaker!</string>
  <string id="10065">And strong, independent women like myself always know what they want.</string>
  <string id="10066">You must leave. You're violating the public order, and the tenants are complaining.</string>
  <string id="10067">Alloisius has an entire collection. They're gifts from his patients. I want to try every single one of them!</string>
  <string id="10068">Alloisius is very inventive! I never would have thought of checking the books!</string>
  <string id="10069">Rum... Exotic! I'll try some with coffee.</string>
  <string id="10070">I don't know. But I think quite a few.</string>
  <string id="10071">And how are you going to pay, Carl?</string>

  <string id="10076">BRIBE (-$5,000)</string>
  <string id="14654">FURNITURE REPAIR</string>
  <string id="14655">I'm here on business. I need to repair the furniture in your apartment.</string>
  <string id="14656">Come in!</string>
  <string id="8566">But I'm here. I nearly lost all hope of finding a decent man I could care for.</string>
  <string id="8567">OK, I won't tell Alloisius. But he wanted to learn more about you so he could make you a gift.</string>
  <string id="8568">And while I was gathering it, most of it expired! So I had to start over - several times.</string>
  <string id="8570">We'll never miss that! It's great to see our doctor happy.</string>
  <string id="8571">I swear - all I want is to quietly leave with him and make him happy.</string>
  <string id="8572">Me, too. I left when I was 17, and I finally made it.</string>
  <string id="8573">I can't let you go to Alloisius yet. We need to talk first. Stay here.</string>
  <string id="8574">At some point, I decided I'd been a victim of the system for too long. It was MY turn to victimize.</string>
  <string id="8575">Exactly. You have no idea what I had to go through to get my passport.</string>
  <string id="8576">You can't prove anything!</string>
  <string id="8577">You're very naïve and romantic, Carl. Here, if that will make you feel better.</string>
  <string id="8578">Hello, I'm Sarah Wattermach, the Raneks' niece. I'm here to meet the doctor.</string>
  <string id="8579">It took me two years to get the papers together.</string>
  <string id="8580">OK. But please - I beg you - don't break my precious man's heart!</string>
  <string id="8581">I don't want someone innocent to die because I let you go.</string>
  <string id="8582">I have nowhere to stay, so I'll be living here. In which apartment does Alloisius live?</string>
  <string id="8583">Speaking of poisoning, give the poison to me!</string>
  <string id="8585">I talked to your so-called aunt. You're not related to the Raneks! So who are you?</string>
  <string id="8586">Who cares who I am? I love him! I swear - the past is the past!</string>
  <string id="8587">You killed him! What an idiot I was allowing that wedding to take place!</string>
  <string id="8588">It was like that at first. But Alloisius became very dear to me.</string>
  <string id="8590">Cruel parents, uncaring teachers, lustful employers...</string>
  <string id="8591">If you tell on me, the officials will find out you knew and did nothing.</string>
  <string id="8593">So go, Carl, and live your worthless life.</string>
  <string id="8594">Leave, Carl, until I decide your family should pay for this.</string>
  <string id="8595">I can't wait! I'll make a 16-course feast!</string>
  <string id="8596">OK, OK. My name is Vera. I had a difficult childhood.</string>
  <string id="8597">I won't tell Alloisius. But you must leave at once.</string>
  <string id="8599">Thank you, Carl. Tell him he's my very best gift.</string>
  <string id="8601">I thought black widows existed only in novels...</string>
  <string id="8602">They were poisoning my life. Now it's my turn!</string>
  <string id="8603">This is arsenic. I hope you put it in your tea.</string>
  <string id="8604">I'm tired of listening to your speeches.</string>
  <string id="8605">No! I'm completely loyal to him!</string>
  <string id="8606">I need to think it over.</string>
  <string id="8607">I'm so happy! Alloisius is an amazing husband!</string>
  <string id="8608">So... Have you found your next victim?</string>
  <string id="8609">They'll quickly expose you!</string>
  <string id="8611">Where would I go? I have nowhere to stay.</string>
  <string id="8612">Come, and bring your family!</string>

  <string id="8632">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="8843">What a shame! Such a great man... How could I leave him?</string>
  <string id="8845">I'm fed up with you, Sarah. It's time for you to leave!</string>
  <string id="8846">I repeat: go away!</string>

  <string id="10079">This is the best coffee in town. With arsenic, of course! See you in hell, sweetie.</string>
  <string id="10080">Everything is settled! I'll soon become Sarah Shpak! Doesn't that sound cute?</string>

  <string id="10105">After what you said, comrade Carl, there's no point in talking further! Burn in hell!</string>
  <string id="9658">Comrade Carl, do you think it's funny to report a child?</string>
  <string id="9659">You're going to pay a high price for your little joke!</string>
  <string id="11891">You're a traitor! You should be given to the same specialists that cured my mind!</string>
  <string id="11892">They'll teach you to love the motherland and our Great Leader!</string>
  <string id="11893">Patrick, we're going to leave the country.</string>
  <string id="11894">You can't do that to your motherland!</string>
  <string id="11895">TELL ABOUT THE TRIP</string>
  <string id="11896">I'm not going anywhere!</string>
  <string id="11897">But Patrick...</string>
  <string id="3150">FINISH CONVERSATION</string>
  <string id="11085">ASK WHAT'S UP</string>
  <string id="11091">What's up, son?</string>
  <string id="10941">I'm doing GREAT! Thanks to our GREAT Leader, everyone in our GREAT nation is doing GREAT!</string>
  <string id="11097">Are you kidding?</string>
  <string id="10986">No! You can't joke about the Great Leader! I hope they prohibit joking in general!</string>
  <string id="10955">Everyone should be thrilled to be living in this Great State - without foolish jokes!</string>
  <string id="10954">They taught us to love the Great State. To be proud of the Great Leader. And to ask no questions.</string>
  <string id="10976">There's only one answer to any question: our Great Leader!</string>
  <string id="10973">He protects us, keeps the peace, and provides everything we need in order to be HAPPY.</string>
  <string id="11043">I don't know what to say... I just don't know...</string>
  <string id="14539">ASK WHAT HE NEEDS</string>
  <string id="11087">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="10964">Yes, father! I want to volunteer and destroy the revolutionists!</string>
  <string id="10956">Viva the Great Leader! Death to the opposition! Burn them and their poisonous books!</string>
  <string id="11074">Are you insane, Patrick?</string>
  <string id="10963">My mind, honor, and conscience belong to the Great Leader and our Great State!</string>
  <string id="11063">What happened to you, son?</string>
  <string id="11037">Oh my God, Patrick! What did they do to you?</string>
  <string id="11035">Questions are a threat to the state!</string>
  <string id="9212">We don't know each other, but I hope we become friends. My name is George Danton.</string>
  <string id="9213">The only thing you need to know now is that we'll pay a good price for this case.</string>
  <string id="9214">After that, I want you to do me a simple but important favor.</string>
  <string id="9215">Who are you? A new tenant? I know everyone who lives in the building, but this is the first time I've seen you.</string>
  <string id="9216">A young man - Fulfledle Brukich - lives in your building. Can you give him this box?</string>
  <string id="9217">I HAVE my reasons. You'll know them after you do me the favor.</string>
  <string id="9218">There's only one condition: do not open the box.</string>
  <string id="9219">Fear divides people. I assure you, we have opposing goals.</string>
  <string id="9220">The one who has relationships and the support of other people survives in this world.</string>
  <string id="9221">Moreover, we feel pressure from above when the authorities demand something impossible, don't we?</string>
  <string id="9222">Later, I'll give you another chance to become friends with our unit.</string>
  <string id="9224">TAKE THE BOX AND GIVE IT TO FULFLEDLE</string>
  <string id="9225">TAKE THE BOX AND BRING IT TO YOUR OFFICE</string>
  <string id="9226">I think you're a decent man who can be trusted.</string>
  <string id="9227">I'm disappointed. I thought you were the kind of person who looked ahead and considered the future.</string>
  <string id="9228">Well, the money won't hurt. Give me the box.</string>
  <string id="9229">Those who don't have it die. Think about it.</string>
  <string id="9230">I don't want to insist, but choose wisely.</string>
  <string id="9231">Aren't you afraid I'll report this to the quarter?</string>
  <string id="9232">Are you trying to get me mixed up in something illegal?</string>
  <string id="9233">Why don't you do it yourself?</string>
  <string id="9234">We shall do everything at the proper time, Carl... We shall do everything at the proper time.</string>
  <string id="9235">Give me the box. I'll do what you're asking.</string>
  <string id="9236">Thanks, Carl. We pay our debts.</string>
  <string id="9237">What unit are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="9238">Is there a chance you'll change your mind?</string>
  <string id="9239">OK. Give me the box.</string>
  <string id="9240">I made inquiries, Carl.</string>
  <string id="9241">How can I help you?</string>
  <string id="9242">TURN DOWN THE DEAL</string>
  <string id="9243">Hello, Carl!</string>
  <string id="9244">What should I do?</string>
  <string id="9245">Very well.</string>
  <string id="9246">Do you agree?</string>
  <string id="12986">You must have read newspapers and know what happened. The situation got out of control.</string>
  <string id="12987">Nobody but me decided to inspect your building. But I believe you. Goodbye, Carl.</string>
  <string id="12988">That's it! He was one of our best comrades. I'll come for him if you allow it.</string>
  <string id="12989">Don't worry! Nothing can threaten your family. We'll transfer a large sum of money to your account.</string>
  <string id="12990">Yes, but we can't find Antoine. Help us, and I'll give you the medicine.</string>
  <string id="12991">Here's the medicine. I knew you wouldn't let me down.</string>
  <string id="12992">Traitor Grubic escaped. What a pity! We'll pay a good price for his head.</string>
  <string id="12993">What a shame! Coming back to where you used to live is a smart plan...</string>
  <string id="12994">TALK ABOUT MARTHA'S MEDICINE</string>
  <string id="12995">You promised to get me Liebespirit!</string>
  <string id="12997">He's in my basement! He asked for shelter...</string>
  <string id="12998">Do you know anything about him?</string>
  <string id="12999">I don't know where he is!</string>
  <string id="13000">Hello, Carl!</string>
  <string id="13001">END CONVERSATION</string>
  <string id="10918">TELL ABOUT THE CALL TO THE MINISTRY</string>
  <string id="10655">I reported you to the Ministry, Danton! I think they're on their way to get you…</string>
  <string id="10687">I was wrong about you, Carl. I thought you were human.</string>
  <string id="10651">No, you're just another cog in the great machine that grinds the innocent into oblivion.</string>
  <string id="10698">I'm mostly sorry for your family.</string>
  <string id="10675">Why would you care about my family?</string>
  <string id="10631">Because even though you're a rat of the state, they're going to miss you...</string>
  <string id="13612">You really need money. Everyone does!</string>
  <string id="13639">LEARN WHAT HE NEEDS</string>
  <string id="13640">GET ACQUAINTED</string>
  <string id="9247">My father says it's better to fulfill the legacies of the Dear Leader in our great state than to make friends with five butt faces in a neighboring country.</string>
  <string id="9248">I just don't understand how chopped-up frogs can help me to become a person who can make the world a better place.</string>
  <string id="9249">Books say he became the leader of the party that overthrew the tyrannical government in 1864!</string>
  <string id="9250">He rescued me! Other than that, all I can tell you is my life would be completely different if it weren't for him.</string>
  <string id="9251">You don't understand anything! You don't have to answer each time you're asked what your weird name means.</string>
  <string id="9252">One a woman went to the king of a neighboring country and asked him to change her last name because of how horrible it sounded.</string>
  <string id="9253">Your silly head is empty! Don't mess with me! Why are you making me angry? You're like everyone else!</string>
  <string id="9254">Damned bureaucrat! My father will kill me when he learns I was kicked out of the university! I guess have nothing to lose!</string>
  <string id="9255">Really? Give me that damned box or you'll be sorry!</string>
  <string id="9256">The king giggled, fulfilled her request and said: "Five will be enough!"</string>
  <string id="9257">You don't hear, "Your father is not only a joker but a patriot," every day!</string>
  <string id="9258">Do you really think you can make jokes about our agency without suffering physical harm?</string>
  <string id="9259">Every time I tell my father about my name, he laughs and says it could be worse...</string>
  <string id="9260">Damn you! Deal! Can I use them to buy what I need on the black market?</string>
  <string id="9261">We chop up different frogs and then mix some shit in flasks until it bubbles and smokes.</string>
  <string id="9262">Don't be nervous, young man! The box was lost in all that mess.</string>
  <string id="9263">Then I'll move out in a couple of days. It's time for great deeds!</string>
  <string id="9264">TALK ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY</string>
  <string id="9265">Chemistry... It's a nice university and such...</string>
  <string id="9266">"There has never been a mistake in the history of our state, young man!"</string>
  <string id="9267">It was a mistake to ask a question during State History class.</string>
  <string id="9268">You're out of line, young man. You're talking to a public servant.</string>
  <string id="9269">Take the money. Perhaps it can compensate you for your loss.</string>
  <string id="9270">"If you don't understand this, then you won't be a good fit for our university."</string>
  <string id="9271">He likes telling the same story, which he finds amusing, over and over.</string>
  <string id="9272">You're damned right I'm threatening you! You and your family!</string>
  <string id="9273">I only asked how old our Great Leader was.</string>
  <string id="9274">I hate liars! If they don't die, you'll die! Rat!</string>
  <string id="9275">Tell that to those ignorant goats who teach at the university.</string>
  <string id="9276">The world will change soon, and there will be no place for people like you!</string>
  <string id="9277">How can I make the world a better place if I can't trust anyone?</string>
  <string id="9278">Do you think I can't deal with a beardless boy?</string>
  <string id="9279">He can't be 120 years old! It's a mistake.</string>
  <string id="9280">Mom calls me Ful. I don't like that, either.</string>
  <string id="9281">I must admit the story is funny.</string>
  <string id="9282">You did what you had to do. Now leave it alone.</string>
  <string id="9283">I see you don't find what you're studying to be inspiring.</string>
  <string id="9284">Hello. I'm Carl, the landlord.</string>
  <string id="9285">Ministry rat! You'll be sorry for what you've done!</string>
  <string id="9286">It means "Fulfill the Legacy of our Dear Leader."</string>
  <string id="9287">TALK ABOUT THE BOX</string>
  <string id="9288">You lied! You study at the university!</string>
  <string id="9289">You were given a box for me. Where is it?</string>
  <string id="9290">They'll be sorry for that soon enough!</string>
  <string id="9291">A good deed won't be finished because of you!</string>
  <string id="9292">Fulfledle Brukich, a student at the university.</string>
  <string id="9293">I was asked to give you this box...</string>
  <string id="9294">Believe me, it's in your own interest.</string>
  <string id="9296">What's your specialty?</string>
  <string id="9297">My father picked this silly name!</string>
  <string id="9298">Those old rats expelled me!</string>

  <string id="9416">Go to hell, Carl. I'm just an engineer in the printing office. If something happens here, it's none of your business.</string>
  <string id="9418">Of course I work for the government. All citizens work for the sake of our great state.</string>
  <string id="9420">That's nonsense! There's no movement. My main goal is to eat well and hit my target.</string>
  <string id="9424">Our mutual friends told me you're one of the best printing specialists around.</string>
  <string id="9425">What are you talking about? I'm a transient. I'm moving to a class B hostel in several days.</string>
  <string id="9426">Thank you. I'm fine with this. Once I'm finished, I'll find a way to express my gratitude.</string>
  <string id="9427">I'm missing the deadline and can't leave this place even for a few minutes.</string>
  <string id="9428">Tell me about the movement you joined. What are its tasks and goals?</string>
  <string id="9430">I'd be grateful if you bring me scissors and paint.</string>
  <string id="9432">I'm talking about a different thing. You deceived Danton and the movement.</string>
  <string id="9433">Of course. Secrecy and other stuff. Sorry for bothering you.</string>
  <string id="9434">It seems you mixed up some things... I don't think we have mutual friends.</string>
  <string id="9435">If you found something, it means you'd throw it down!</string>
  <string id="9436">Ah, you mean this one. It's a small task I decided to complete at home.</string>
  <string id="9437">Don't worry about this; it won't disturb the tenants.</string>
  <string id="9438">I need a couple of items for the work I took to complete at home.</string>
  <string id="9442">What about the leaflets you had to print?</string>
  <string id="9443">I found paint for you. I hope you like this color.</string>
  <string id="9445">If you don't like them, I can use them myself...</string>
  <string id="9446">Thank you! Is it just me or are they rather silly?</string>
  <string id="9448">Excuse me, but everything is OK. Thank you for your help!</string>
  <string id="9451">You turned me in, you damned rat! You turned me in!</string>
  <string id="9453">You won't let me complete these tasks!</string>
  <string id="9454">You asked for a few things...</string>
  <string id="9455">I'm Carl, the landlord.</string>

  <string id="10250">You've made a huge mistake…</string>
  <string id="10287">You see an intricate tangle. Someone put a lot of effort into making it hard to take down the banners...</string>
  <string id="10288">How am I supposed to cut this with my bare hands?</string>

  <string id="10293">A beam falls down and hits Carl on the head - hard!</string>
  <string id="10294">Having put a lot of effort into cutting the line, Carl realized it was all for nothing. The banner stayed where it was.</string>
  <string id="10295">The banner falls with a crash. Carl sighs with relief.</string>
  <string id="10296">Carl stares at the knot and contemplates eternity…</string>

  <string id="10302">Carl notices a cache under the roof, where the lines are fastened. He finds banner fabric hidden there, and a tag attached to the fabric.</string>
  <string id="10303">After 30 minutes of heavy labor, Carl managed to cut the line, and the banner fell.</string>
  <string id="10304">Trying to reach the line, Carl trips and falls.</string>
  <string id="10305">Someone set up a trap, and Carl is showered with garbage.</string>

  <string id="10318">Well, I wouldn't mind dinner or, better yet, some booze. Get me a bottle of rum, and I'll be happy to return to my barracks.</string>
  <string id="10319">Justas Markovich. This is the mobile propaganda unit. According to our schedule, we'll be here for four days. Enjoy, Carl!</string>
  <string id="10320">I need to set the frequency on the panel, as well as a few other options you don't need to know about.</string>
  <string id="10321">Remember: we are to celebrate our Great Leader's birthday!</string>
  <string id="10322">Sorry, but the keys to the mobile propaganda unit didn't appear in my pocket. Your magic button isn't working.</string>

  <string id="10725">That was the right thing to do! The most important citizens should be saved first. Give it here; I need to drink it immediately.</string>
  <string id="10726">Airel Johnson, retired general. Here to boost the patriotic spirit of our youth.</string>
  <string id="10727">Who knows, comrade Carl? Life taught me to not trust anyone, especially clerks.</string>
  <string id="10728">There was a gas leak at the chemical plant! I was told to hand out antidotes that should be consumed immediately.</string>
  <string id="10729">OK... Let's see who had the guts to test his luck with the Aglow Butcher. Ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="10730">This is classified. I received an antidote for you and me. My family hasn't even received a dose yet!</string>
  <string id="10731">By the way, it was delivered by a very pretty, though rather shy, young lady. She's a big fan of yours!</string>
  <string id="10732">I prefer to deal with those rebellious rats on my own!</string>
  <string id="10733">Oh, Carl, if only I received a pound of foie gras every time an enemy tries to kill me…</string>
  <string id="10734">A little bit of training, and we'll have a squad of bona fide slayers... I mean soldiers! Soldiers...</string>
  <string id="10735">Why does it smell like a donut? Drugs and antidotes taste bitter!</string>
  <string id="10736">I promised to help her meet you. Here's money for flowers, in case you're interested.</string>
  <string id="10737">My final speech is to be given to the school kids at the stadium. Feel free to come with your children!</string>
  <string id="10738">We're at the breaking point of the war; food will start arriving soon!</string>
  <string id="10739">I'll give several speeches and lectures, and will then move on to, you know, educating the rest of the masses.</string>
  <string id="10740">Freshly drafted youth come to stand by the building in which their idol lives.</string>
  <string id="10741">If you don't have the time to fulfill my requests, I'll report it to the Ministry.</string>
  <string id="10742">OK, OK, Carl! You're right. Sometimes, it's good to show the people I'm still full of energy.</string>
  <string id="10743">Airel, your champagne is here. But there are several kinds, and I'm not an expert.</string>
  <string id="10744">For now, there's not enough food for everyone. But those who serve our state honestly get to eat.</string>
  <string id="10745">Unfortunately, that's not possible. Some of this champagne is meant for the Minister.</string>
  <string id="10746">Oh, well. Our youth are, you know, our base. I don't want to offend them by saying no.</string>
  <string id="10747">Who cares? Bring it in! I'll have no trouble choosing one.</string>
  <string id="10748">I gave a speech to the patriotic camp alumni. You should've seen their reaction! It was glorious!</string>
  <string id="10749">I think she's a fan. She was too shy to bring it in herself, so she asked me to do it.</string>
  <string id="10750">Take care of it, Carl! I'm not 15, and I'm not a courier!</string>
  <string id="10751">It smells funny. I'm not going to drink it. You take a sip.</string>
  <string id="10752">All in great shape, eyes full of fire, ready to fight like, you know, young dogs!</string>
  <string id="10753">Do you really think that I, a state official, would try to poison you?</string>
  <string id="10754">It smells great. But I just ate. And I've never seen this stuff before…</string>
  <string id="10755">I'd have built a foie gras palace long ago, on Foie Gras Island.</string>
  <string id="10756">I was asked to give you this novelty digestive!</string>
  <string id="10757">They wanted me to lure you out of the house and send you to the corner.</string>
  <string id="10758">Hold on, Carl. You did well by coming to me about this.</string>
  <string id="10759">I'll complain about your negligence!</string>
  <string id="10760">Thanks for your diligence and, you know, loyalty to the state!</string>
  <string id="10761">Are you drunk, or have you watched too much TV? That's a lousy joke, Carl.</string>
  <string id="10762">But I don't need it; I'm as healthy as a horse! I'll outlive all of you!</string>
  <string id="10763">Airel, someone sent a gift for you through me. I was asked to deliver it personally.</string>
  <string id="10764">What do you think, comrade Johnson? What future awaits us?</string>
  <string id="10765">You should've said so! I like young ones...</string>
  <string id="10766">Local revolutionaries! I'll report this to the Ministry!</string>
  <string id="10767">I keep getting huge bills with your name on them…</string>
  <string id="10768">Terrible news, Airel! They want to kill you!</string>
  <string id="10769">That's easy to solve, Carl: bring in all of it!</string>

  <string id="11410">But instead of threatening to use it and thus ending the war, your government prefers to keep quiet and continue sending people to die.</string>
  <string id="11411">I'm helping the New Tomorrow guys, mostly with papers for those willing to escape the country.</string>
  <string id="11412">I'm not helping the New Tomorrow out of altruism. This movement has every chance of changing the government.</string>
  <string id="11413">You see, Carl, both sides in this war are supporting the conflict in an effort to grow richer.</string>
  <string id="11414">I knew I could count on you! Here are clean papers for everyone in your family, in case you decide to emigrate. Simply glue your pictures to the empty squares.</string>
  <string id="11415">Besides, if you and your family ever need papers likes these, you know where to get them.</string>
  <string id="11416">You must be crazy, Albert, to think I'll help you steal classified blueprints!</string>
  <string id="11417">I can help you out, too, if you ever need it. All you have to do is bring me any passports you have, and I'll produce clean papers for you.</string>
  <string id="11418">But it creates factory and mine jobs, and allows for oppositionists to be sent to the battlefield and buried there.</string>
  <string id="11419">I need your help. Find me three passports to forge into emigration papers.</string>
  <string id="11420">The only way to end it is to gain the ultimate advantage. I'm talking A-bomb here, Carl.</string>
  <string id="11421">Oh, well. Usually that's when I tell tenants to tell me if they ever need anything.</string>
  <string id="11422">And how is your mute approach to the revolution going to prevent more blood baths?</string>
  <string id="11423">Good luck! Remember: once you're at the border, don't run. If you do, the guards will set their dogs on you.</string>
  <string id="11424">Wouldn't it have been better to manufacture pots and clothes instead of gunpowder, bullets, and coffins?</string>
  <string id="11425">This will STOP THE WAR! Do you think that massacre will end on its own?</string>
  <string id="11426">That's a shame. Only a madman would be willing to withdraw from what's happening.</string>
  <string id="11427">The A-bomb blueprints, Carl, which will help me end this pointless war.</string>
  <string id="11428">Using it is out of question, Carl. It would leave nothing standing. That's not what we need.</string>
  <string id="11429">But if we get it, we'll end this senseless violence in a day!</string>
  <string id="11430">Too bad. I guess I should go, then. Farewell, Carl.</string>
  <string id="11431">And how is you pretending to be mute going to help?</string>
  <string id="11432">I trust you. I think it's time to reveal the truth.</string>
  <string id="11433">My real name is, indeed, Albert Meineke. And I'm here on assignment from the state.</string>

  <string id="11550">Since when do you have a dog? Damn you, Carl! How will I explain that at work?</string>

  <string id="11706">I'm talking real papers, Carl. That requires a lot of signatures, authorizations, and confirmations from several departments.</string>
  <string id="11707">In the last news, they want to merge the Ministry of Agriculture with the Ministry of Culture.</string>
  <string id="11708">Besides, being an illegal alien in the country to which you are going to will force you to hide forever.</string>
  <string id="11709">It's much cheaper to run away with smugglers, but there's no guarantee you won't be caught at the border.</string>
  <string id="11710">Then it will be easier to get the paperwork, and you'll need less money.</string>
  <string id="11711">But as soon as you have all that, you'll be real citizens living there legally.</string>
  <string id="11712">Their Beetroot Motherland fest and the "Patriots Eat Turnips" play are very popular.</string>
  <string id="11713">There are plenty of ministries; the state controls everything. I even heard there are revolutionists here.</string>
  <string id="11714">Thanks! You've eased my mind. I've got a big family; not all of them are here yet - just me and my wife.</string>
  <string id="11715">George. I'm not sure I should discuss this with you, but...can you help me and my family emigrate?</string>
  <string id="11716">Ministry of Agriculture. We are busy arranging patriotic concerts in the fields.</string>
  <string id="11717">I thought moving here would solve my problems. But it's no different from what we left behind.</string>
  <string id="11718">Well, control isn't such a bad thing. But yes, we do, indeed, have plenty of ministries.</string>
  <string id="11719">Don't worry; there haven't been any orders about accents or illegal aliens yet.</string>
  <string id="11720">Yes. There are still some other options, though they're pretty costly.</string>
  <string id="11721">Have you heard of the Ministry of the Dental Innovations? And the Ministry of Stamps?</string>
  <string id="11722">I have my hands full: there's my wife, my son, my mother-in-law, my uncle, my niece…</string>
  <string id="11723">Between us, we moved because I had issues at my old job…</string>
  <string id="11724">That's not what I meant. It's just that foreigners are rare here.</string>
  <string id="11725">Immigration service inspector. Sat there checking passports.</string>
  <string id="11726">You must be an expert on papers, visas and such then.</string>
  <string id="11727">Congratulations! Soon, it will all be over, and a new life will start. A real life, Carl!</string>
  <string id="11728">Oh no, there was no time to be bored. The immigration regulations kept changing every day.</string>
  <string id="11730">Also, if you have friends here or abroad, we can get in touch with them.</string>
  <string id="11731">Do you need any documents allowing you to leave the country? Passports, tickets, etc.</string>
  <string id="11732">Do you know what's up with foreign travel nowadays? Are we allowed to go abroad?</string>
  <string id="11733">Okay, I'll help you, but it will be expensive. At least $145,000.</string>
  <string id="11734">DISCUSS EMIGRATION</string>
  <string id="11735">Hello there. I'm George Dreiman. We just moved here.</string>
  <string id="11736">I'm currently looking for a job. I applied at the Ministry of Employment.</string>
  <string id="11737">I used to be an immigration officer.</string>
  <string id="11738">Recently, they created the Ministry of Supervision and put it over the Ministry of Strict Control.</string>
  <string id="11739">They're rehearsing a new play called "The Potato Flag of International Friendship."</string>
  <string id="11740">It's huge! But that's because you have no friends.</string>
  <string id="11741">Our papers are fine. I didn't know having an accent was against the law.</string>
  <string id="11742">Not just local ones, but also ones from the country to which you want to travel.</string>
  <string id="11744">You came prepared, Carl. This will make the final amount $10,000 less.</string>
  <string id="11746">I have cruise tickets with open-ended dates and passenger names.</string>

  <string id="11748">I'm not sure yet, but it could come in handy.</string>
  <string id="11749">I decided whether or not to let people into the country.</string>
  <string id="11750">We have what we have. Tell me if you need help.</string>
  <string id="11751">Not yet, although it's hard to keep track of everything that comes up.</string>
  <string id="11752">Too bad. Alas, the amount remains the same.</string>
  <string id="11753">Great! Anything else?</string>
  <string id="11754">I understand. Are there ways to reduce it?</string>
  <string id="11755">If you do, bring it over, and we'll talk more.</string>
  <string id="11756">You named the amount I need in order to leave!</string>
  <string id="11758">Hello. I'm Carl, the landlord.</string>
  <string id="11760">Well, let's just say there were all sorts of people.</string>
  <string id="11762">Is it noticeable? Will we get in trouble?</string>
  <string id="11764">Stop it. I can't listen to this anymore.</string>
  <string id="11765">Do you want to leave? Are you having issues at work?</string>
  <string id="11766">You have an accent. Where are you from?</string>
  <string id="11767">Is there no one to help you?</string>
  <string id="11768">Sounds boring.</string>
  <string id="11769">DISCUSS THE BORDER SITUATION</string>
  <string id="11770">So what did you say you did before?</string>

  <string id="11772">I can easily spot a fake.</string>
  <string id="11773">And what will it be called?</string>
  <string id="11774">I have nothing like that.</string>
  <string id="11776">I don't have the money yet.</string>

  <string id="11780">TALK LATER</string>
  <string id="11781">I also have clean passports.</string>
  <string id="11782">I see. Thanks, George.</string>
  <string id="11783">NO DOCUMENTS</string>
  <string id="11784">I have the money!</string>
  <string id="11785">A lot, indeed.</string>
  <string id="11786">Got the papers?</string>
  <string id="11787">DISCUSS THE COUNTRY</string>
  <string id="11789">DISCUSS WORK</string>
  <string id="11790">Let's proceed.</string>
  <string id="11791">What do you do for work?</string>
  <string id="11792">Others are on their way.</string>
  <string id="11793">NOTHING ELSE</string>
  <string id="11794">END CONVERSATION</string>
  <string id="11795">Let's talk later.</string>
  <string id="11796">Give $[$go_away]</string>
  <string id="11804">How do you like it here?</string>
  <string id="11805">MEET</string>
  <string id="11807">HOW MUCH?!</string>
  <string id="11808">Others?</string>
  <string id="11809">No.</string>
  <string id="13522">LEAVE WITHOUT MONEY</string>
  <string id="13524">NO</string>
  <string id="13525">YES</string>
  <string id="13526">Are you sure, Carl? It's very risky!</string>
  <string id="13527">As you wish.</string>
  <string id="11811">It was incredibly cold where we lived before. Almost everything we earned went to pay the heating bill.</string>
  <string id="11812">My son was always sick, and then my husband started having troubles at work. That scared us.</string>
  <string id="11813">That's horrible, indeed. We often have to choose between food and heat.</string>
  <string id="11814">And once, a terrorist attacked the checkpoint, and my husband had to shoot him!</string>
  <string id="11815">As I understand, your husband used to be an immigration officer. How did you like it there?</string>
  <string id="11816">That place is no paradise, either, but at least it's warmer than here.</string>
  <string id="11817">That sounds weird. I've never heard of such a tradition. Where are you from?</string>
  <string id="11818">It was awful! There were constant raids and emergencies, and we were always broke...</string>
  <string id="11819">I hope we'll be safe here.</string>
  <string id="11820">It's no resort here. That dust is from the mines...</string>
  <string id="11821">Far away, Carl. Best talk about this with my husband.</string>
  <string id="11822">So the local weather is nothing to complain about.</string>
  <string id="11823">No. But they really liked these names.</string>
  <string id="11824">DISCUSS LIFE ON THE BORDER</string>
  <string id="11825">I'm Carl, the landlord.</string>
  <string id="11826">What an interesting name.</string>
  <string id="11827">I was named after my grandmothers.</string>
  <string id="11828">Were their names Krista and Maria?</string>
  <string id="11829">DISCUSS THE WEATHER</string>
  <string id="11830">Krista-Maria Dreiman.</string>
  <string id="11831">How do you like the weather?</string>
  <string id="11832">MEET</string>
  <string id="11833">It's horrible!</string>
  <string id="14563">FINISH CONVERSATION</string>
  <string id="11834">My son is an idiot! He moved to the wrong country, and is completely screwed. I'll have to get him out somehow.</string>
  <string id="11835">If only Patrick went abroad, like he wanted to. But I didn't help him. And he hates this country now.</string>
  <string id="11836">I risked my family to help Danton! He should help in return.</string>
  <string id="11837">If it wasn't for me, she and her daughter would've perished. I can count on her.</string>
  <string id="11838">My son is a zombie patriot. He's useless.</string>
  <string id="11839">They would've helped if their destiny had been different.</string>
  <string id="11840">Alas, we're not friends anymore.</string>
  <string id="11841">Do you have anyone abroad who could help you?</string>
  <string id="11842">I helped him acquire the blueprints he needed. He should help!</string>
  <string id="11843">I helped them emigrate. They'll help!</string>
  <string id="11844">Alas, we're no longer the friends we were...</string>
  <string id="11845">Looking for trouble.</string>
  <string id="11846">This will lower your costs substantially.</string>
  <string id="11847">Let me think... Who can help me?</string>
  <string id="11848">We didn't get along.</string>
  <string id="11849">Where does he get it from?</string>
  <string id="11850">My son is no help.</string>
  <string id="11851">My son is dead…</string>
  <string id="11852">INGA BIRKENFELD</string>
  <string id="11853">ALBERT MEINEKE</string>
  <string id="11854">SchimmerS</string>
  <string id="11855">DANTON</string>
  <string id="11856">PATRICK</string>
  <string id="14220">My son will help me. He went to South Borea!</string>
  <string id="12226">Emigration costs: $[$go_away]</string>
  <string id="12234">Let's see who can help you.</string>
  <string id="12380">Unfortunately, society has once again forgotten that spanking is the best way to deal with a misfit who ruins books!</string>
  <string id="12381">I remember tearing pages out of several pathetic memoires. I purposefully chose a certain article... I can't remember what it was about.</string>
  <string id="12382">WHAT?! That was you?! For an article removed from "Memoires of the Great Leader," I was accused of...</string>
  <string id="12383">Patriotism should be burned onto our brows and backs, not instilled through boring lectures!</string>
  <string id="12384">You're young, Carl. You'd feel warm even in the Arctic. At my age, it's always freezing.</string>
  <string id="12385">We met about 10 years ago. I worked at the library of the 42nd teaching block.</string>
  <string id="12386">Because the idea that we're a fortress under siege is failing us. We expect to be attacked from the outside!</string>
  <string id="12387">These fools can't fight properly! If I were in charge, I would've exterminated all of our enemies long ago!</string>
  <string id="12388">No, Carl, I don't have children. They're the antithesis of everything I love: order and quiet.</string>
  <string id="12389">When I was a kid, I ruined plenty of books. I did it when I got older, too…</string>
  <string id="12390">The neighbors started making noise; someone was cursing their boss over their phone... Need I continue?</string>
  <string id="12391">Calm down, Margaret. That's in the past; I'm a state official now.</string>
  <string id="12392">First, they let the country deteriorate into civil unrest, then they expect a talking booth to fix everything?</string>
  <string id="12393">It must be quiet! Not only in the libraries, but in the apartments of honest citizens, too!</string>
  <string id="12394">What can I say? You lived your life for a reason, though in vain.</string>
  <string id="12395">The history of mankind is about the bloodshed. Have you been ditching school?</string>
  <string id="12396">Juvenile romanticism is inevitably replaced by senile rheumatism...</string>
  <string id="12398">Nice to meet you. I attended the 42nd block.</string>
  <string id="12399">You probably don't remember me, and I have a good memory for faces.</string>
  <string id="12400">Come to my library. I'll give you some textbooks on the history of war.</string>
  <string id="12401">Margaret, the mobile propaganda unit blew up! Did you do that?</string>
  <string id="12402">That's a mobile propaganda unit. It'll leave in a couple of days.</string>
  <string id="12403">TALK ABOUT THE MOBILE PROPAGANDA UNIT</string>
  <string id="12404">You have stern views on bringing up children. Do you have kids?</string>
  <string id="12405">This is unacceptable! The country is racing toward chaos!</string>
  <string id="12406">Do you know why we can't win this war, Carl?</string>
  <string id="12407">And the real enemies are right here, under our noses!</string>
  <string id="12408">I wouldn't last a day in the children's library.</string>
  <string id="12409">Seven years! Seven years of camps, Carl!!! All because of you!</string>
  <string id="12410">I'll calm down. But I'll never forgive you.</string>
  <string id="12411">I heard them calling out to overthrow the government! Is that a joke?</string>
  <string id="12412">I don't know how to apologize to you...</string>
  <string id="12413">That's unacceptable! It makes my windows rattle!</string>
  <string id="12414">I don't know; something must've broken down.</string>
  <string id="12415">The flower pot on the first floor is full of cigarette butts!</string>
  <string id="12416">So that's what that awful noise was! Did it burn down?</string>
  <string id="12417">Have you seen anything suspicious, Margaret?</string>
  <string id="12418">What could be better than guarding books from people?</string>
  <string id="12419">You won't ruin another life, you scum!</string>
  <string id="12420">I'm an old woman. I need peace and quiet!</string>
  <string id="12421">The fridge door won't open</string>
  <string id="12422">TELL HER YOU RUINED BOOKS</string>
  <string id="12424">Don't you think that's too much?</string>
  <string id="12425">Whose car is that by our building?</string>
  <string id="12426">I will if it's clean and quiet.</string>
  <string id="12427">I hope you'll like living in our building.</string>
  <string id="12428">But that's government propaganda!</string>

  <string id="12435">Nonsense, Carl Stein.</string>
  <string id="12436">I'm Carl, the landlord.</string>
  <string id="12437">I can't help it!</string>
  <string id="12438">This fish rots from both ends!</string>
  <string id="12439">Margaret Zauer, librarian.</string>
  <string id="12440">I won't hide my joy!</string>
  <string id="12441">Oh, no. I'm saving my nerves.</string>
  <string id="12442">And no kids!</string>
  <string id="12443">Do you like your job?</string>
  <string id="12444">This is the warmest autumn we've had in awhile.</string>

  <string id="12455">Someone is stealing the mail.</string>
  <string id="12456">No thanks!</string>
  <string id="12457">Absolutely!</string>
  <string id="12458">JOKE</string>
  <string id="12459">Going to jail for destroying a radio on wheels is ridiculous. Murder is more like me!</string>
  <string id="12460">Some people come back from the battlefield, but no one has ever returned from prison. That's where one can have some real fun!</string>
  <string id="12461">Damn my father. He made it so they won't draft me, but I dealt with this...issue.</string>
  <string id="12462">And get away with it! War is the best idea ever!</string>
  <string id="12463">That's a great idea! Jail could be more fun than going to war!</string>
  <string id="12464">I'll report you, and you'll go to prison instead of a battlefield!</string>
  <string id="12465">I just want &lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#D53838FF&gt;to kill people.&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</string>
  <string id="12466">Why, exactly? Do you want to defend your country, or to be a hero?</string>
  <string id="12468">I'll have best weapons and protection. Dad will make sure of it.</string>
  <string id="12469">That's a mobile propaganda unit. It'll leave in a couple of days.</string>
  <string id="12470">I saw your wife making out with a stranger! Ha ha ha!</string>
  <string id="12471">TALK ABOUT THE MOLOTOV COCKTAIL</string>
  <string id="12472">What is that delirium? Turn off that radio at once!</string>
  <string id="12473">Me. Or maybe not. Or maybe you? You blew it up!</string>
  <string id="12474">What are you talking about? Leave me alone.</string>
  <string id="12475">I'll choose an apartment building with a mute landlord next time.</string>
  <string id="12476">I found a Molotov cocktail in your apartment!</string>

  <string id="12495">You BLEW UP THE MOBILE PROPAGANDA UNIT!</string>

  <string id="12509">Well, well, well...</string>
  <string id="12510">Anything new?</string>
  <string id="12511">Yes, sir.</string>
  <string id="12512">I did.</string>
  <string id="12513">What?</string>
  <string id="12514">Yes</string>
  <string id="12515">I assemble the engines for the appliances the state puts in its apartment buildings. You must think that's not feminine, but there are a lot of women at our plant.</string>
  <string id="12516">Very funny, Carl. Male humor? If housewives governed the country, people wouldn't be hungry!</string>
  <string id="12517">I work at the plant, and I like putting mechanisms together. Don't freak out if my apartment starts to smell like solder.</string>
  <string id="12518">Do you think everyone around here is an idiot? If that's a radio, where's the speaker? And why was it assembled so hastily?</string>
  <string id="12519">We host appliance assembly competitions, and a woman broke the record in the laundry machines category!</string>
  <string id="12520">Unlike male politicians, who are unpleasant, female politicians are simply disgusting!</string>
  <string id="12521">Our shift manager is a woman, too! She's thinking of becoming a politician.</string>
  <string id="12522">I work on the conveyer belt, and grow very tired, so I don't have the energy to commute.</string>
  <string id="12523">Are you kidding, Carl? I'm sorry, but my headache is getting worse, so I don't feel like laughing...</string>
  <string id="12524">Oh! My migraine just went away... But that noise is making my head hurt even more.</string>
  <string id="12525">Would you mind if I take one of the laundry machines apart over the weekend, Carl?</string>
  <string id="12526">Something sounds funny in it. It's as though someone tried washing an alarm clock.</string>
  <string id="12527">Because, just like Santa Klaus, they are imaginary figures in our country!</string>
  <string id="12528">So you think because I work at a plant, I can make a bomb and blow up a car?</string>
  <string id="12529">Your views on women are so broad, they're completely out of line.</string>
  <string id="12530">They work great. I check the meters constantly. Why do you ask?</string>
  <string id="12531">Do you have any proof I blew up the car?</string>
  <string id="12533">And if I dislike the soup in the canteen, do you think I'll blow that up as well?</string>
  <string id="12534">Working a conveyor belt is an interesting job. What exactly do you do?</string>
  <string id="12535">The skies were clear only once or twice this week. It's going to get really cold soon.</string>
  <string id="12536">It's not OK to run a mobile propaganda unit at full volume day and night!</string>
  <string id="12537">That's a mobile propaganda unit. It'll leave in a couple of days.</string>
  <string id="12538">I'm not kidding! The car was bothering you, and you blew it up! It makes sense!</string>
  <string id="12539">Me, too! Is the fire alarm in the apartment working?</string>
  <string id="12540">Can't you tell radio parts from a bomb?</string>
  <string id="12541">I finally found a good apartment close to the plant.</string>
  <string id="12542">Your chauvinism is making my head hurt again.</string>
  <string id="12543">This is disgusting! Nobody cares for people!</string>
  <string id="12544">No. I have no proof. Sorry, Rowena.</string>

  <string id="12574">MEET</string>
  <string id="12575">Why?</string>
  <string id="12576">When I was young, we used to joke that we're all the same in our country: our faces are grey from coal dust, and only the whites of our eyes are visible.</string>
  <string id="12577">You! You! How dare you mock an officer! I'll remove your tonsils through your ass - bare-handed!</string>
  <string id="12578">I think so, too! I have a sack of rotten grain. I hope they prohibit that, too. I'll finally be rich!</string>
  <string id="12579">Because I found the same spoiled banner in your apartment! Were you using it for training?</string>
  <string id="12580">And poor kids. They're like sponges, sucking in all of that propaganda crap...</string>
  <string id="12581">I used to build airplanes. I flew them, too! Now I have to be a security guard! UGH!</string>

  <string id="12583">DISCUSS THE RUINED BANNER</string>
  <string id="12584">I found half of a pack of wet foreign salt in the shed and sold it.</string>
  <string id="12585">I spent hours putting them on, and then I found out one of the banners was ruined!</string>
  <string id="12586">Ah ha! Thanks, son! I'll draw you something really badass!</string>
  <string id="12587">Hey, listen, don't tell on me, boy, OK? I'm too old to go to jail...</string>
  <string id="12588">Ah ha! Thanks, son! I'll draw you something really badass!</string>
  <string id="12589">Hey, listen, don't tell on me, boy, OK? I'm too old to go to jail...</string>
  <string id="12590">Fall sucks. Then again, that country is always draped in the same depressing grey...</string>
  <string id="12591">You keep talking about the good old days. Was it really that much better for you back then?</string>
  <string id="12592">But hardly anyone could afford even a piece of the abundance...</string>
  <string id="12593">You lousy joker! Do you have any idea what we used to do with those in the army?</string>
  <string id="12594">Sorry, buddy. I'm old; I didn't consider the consequences...</string>
  <string id="12595">You had to work a lot and think even more. And now everything is decided for you.</string>
  <string id="12596">It was worthless before, but after the ban went into effect, someone gave me a fortune for it.</string>
  <string id="12597">No, old man. I can't take that risk.</string>
  <string id="12598">I never knew you were such a good man. Respect, Carl Stein!</string>
  <string id="12599">What are you talking about? Where would an old guy get foreign salt? I don't even salt my food anymore.</string>
  <string id="12600">You just appear at work and get what you're due.</string>
  <string id="12601">What's there to talk about? You're going to report me, right? So, go ahead.</string>

  <string id="13164">We shouldn't talk. Take a gift for my idol.</string>
  <string id="13165">But I want to have a personal date!</string>
  <string id="13166">Sorry, I'm very busy.</string>
  <string id="13179">I have a difficult dilemma. My sister's house burned down recently. She and her family live close to the frontline. I want to move them here.</string>
  <string id="13180">I've heard that because of the ban on imported apples, Paradise Gardens plans to grow a new kind of domestic apple!</string>
  <string id="13181">You already know that we have problems with food in our country. I'm sure an investment in this will be highly profitable.</string>
  <string id="13182">Moreover, Horns and Hoofs plans to implement a waste-free production process. So, the meat will be sold and the rest will be jellied.</string>
  <string id="13183">I'm buying gifts for my nieces and nephews. I found a shop where you can buy honey cockerels and cranberries with sugar.</string>
  <string id="13184">Really? Right after the award ceremony, a few guys asked me to exchange it. They gave me their contact information. I need to get in touch with them.</string>
  <string id="13185">Frauds? I didn't even think about that! I'm an honest citizen. I've faithfully and loyally worked at the factory for more than 20 years!</string>
  <string id="13186">I'm confused. I got my money today... But I'm not sure I can manage it properly.</string>
  <string id="13187">Sure! It's smoking, so the factory is operational! That means people are working, the country will get rich, and life will improve!</string>
  <string id="13188">I'll recommend an option that's risky but very profitable: invest your money in foreign currency.</string>
  <string id="13189">Just I wanted. I thought if I could multiply my money, I'd be able to help more people.</string>
  <string id="13190">I bought a two-piece suit at the funeral shop, but there were no ties. The department store is also out of ties.</string>
  <string id="13191">Great deal! I love cranberries, too. Remember: you can buy only two packs at a time.</string>
  <string id="13192">The safest investment is a savings bank! There are a lot of frauds out there...</string>
  <string id="13193">I took a tour of the machine tool manufactory today. You could teach us a lot!</string>
  <string id="13194">I'm also going to buy new work shoes! And a case for my tools!</string>
  <string id="13195">But I think you're right, Carl! I'll keep some of the money for necessities and deposit the rest.</string>
  <string id="13196">Thank you for reminding me! My sister and her family have no home. I need to help them.</string>
  <string id="13197">Two packs? Then I'll make a few trips. There are so many barges loaded down with coal. Isn't that amazing?</string>
  <string id="13198">Yes, I'm sure! Jellied meat will be our national cuisine someday!</string>
  <string id="13199">Could you help me to find a tie? Everyone will be OK. I just can't go shopping.</string>
  <string id="13200">Sure! The future belongs to domestic apples! They'll make us famous someday!</string>
  <string id="13201">I have to go to the administrative offices tomorrow. There's going to be an award ceremony.</string>
  <string id="13202">I'm simple man; I work at a factory. I've never owned a suit.</string>
  <string id="13203">I feel fortunate for the first time in my long, difficult life.</string>
  <string id="13204">I won the labor lottery, and have come to the award ceremony.</string>
  <string id="13205">You should help your relatives. What could be more important?</string>
  <string id="13206">But I have no family. My co-workers are my family.</string>
  <string id="13207">I am Leo Gvizdek. I will be here for a few days attending to an important matter.</string>
  <string id="13208">Do you really believe the pipes in the factory are OK?</string>
  <string id="13209">I'm sure you won't be sorry. In this case, I believe the risk will be worth it.</string>
  <string id="13210">I understand your doubts. Don't make a hasty decision.</string>
  <string id="13211">All factors are showing that there will be a major default, and the exchange rate will rise.</string>
  <string id="13212">Yes, they want to make jellied meat our national dish.</string>

  <string id="13281">If you could help me invest in a good business, we'd have enough money to buy a vacation home!</string>
  <string id="13282">OK, I'll tell you! I saw a landlord give his tenants bad advice!</string>
  <string id="13283">I told Leo since he moved me in with him, he has to buy me a fur coat. It's really cold here!</string>
  <string id="13284">He spent the rest of his money on pedigree chickens. He wanted to sell them to the factory's cafeteria.</string>
  <string id="13285">I offered a piece of advice. My acquaintance didn't know who to sell the chickens to, so I made an offer to my brother.</string>
  <string id="13286">I don't know yet. I came to do a little shopping. My brother, Leo Gvizdek, suggested I stay in your building.</string>
  <string id="13287">Well, between moving, renovating the house, and buying the chickens and the fur coat, the money didn't last. It wasn't much to begin with.</string>
  <string id="13288">He helped my family to move to the north, where he is. Now we all live in one big house.</string>
  <string id="13289">I took the money from him before he spent it on drink. And we have only dog coats.</string>
  <string id="13290">He won the labor lottery and lived in your house before he received the prize.</string>
  <string id="13291">Spending the rest of the money on a fur coat is a bad idea, don't you think?</string>
  <string id="13292">But they all dried up after the first, light frosts. He was eating them and crying...</string>
  <string id="13293">So, since I've moved here, maybe I'll find something respectable to do.</string>
  <string id="13294">No! Don't say that! I just helped my friend make some money.</string>

  <string id="13360">I will make a contribution with pleasure!</string>
  <string id="13361">I'm not going to make a contribution. It's all a bunch of women's nonsense!</string>
  <string id="13362">$5,000, comrade Carl!</string>

  <string id="13408">But those kinds of fight are illegal! And he - out of sheer mockery of the law - called his champion Wise Chief.</string>
  <string id="13409">Moreover, he grew the cocks at home. And they shit everywhere they could - even in the borscht!</string>
  <string id="13410">Although he hasn't lost a single fight, he's disrespecting our Great Leader!</string>

  <string id="13412">Glory to the Chief. I left my husband at the right time and found happiness at one of the factory's machines.</string>
  <string id="13413">Well, yes, he made a lot of money because he was the best in this business.</string>
  <string id="13414">I was married, comrade Carl. I cooked, washed clothes, and cleaned.</string>
  <string id="13415">Fighting cocks? How much did he earn?</string>
  <string id="13416">And what do you think my husband did? Nothing!</string>

  <string id="13510">I'll stay with you for a couple of days.</string>
  <string id="14629">Greetings, Carl!</string>
  <string id="14614">I have heard that an inspection is planned. Do you think you will pass it?</string>
  <string id="14599">I do not know what to say. Once the inspection is inevitable and nothing can be changed, let things drift.</string>
  <string id="14600">I'm afraid, you have already made all or almost all possible. The inspection will reveal all the violations, if any.</string>
  <string id="14628">What are you implying?</string>
  <string id="14624">I am not implying anything, I am blunt.</string>
  <string id="14601">If you are not sure that you were a perfect employee, or you think that you made some mistakes...</string>
  <string id="14602">But since ordinary people like me have control... We can forgive many things to faithful servants of the people.</string>
  <string id="14605">And it is only because a man is a poor creature with passions, emotions and weaknesses.</string>
  <string id="14608">And the State is a machine aimed at the public good, though forced.</string>
  <string id="14611">It is not too late to change your fate and the fate of our beautiful country, Carl.</string>
  <string id="14610">Make a solid contribution to the needs of our great Motherland and get a second chance.</string>
  <string id="14613">You see... The State does not make mistakes, but people do.</string>
  <string id="14616">Are you sure you devoted yourself to the Motherland in full?</string>
  <string id="14622">MAKE A MILITARY CONTRIBUTION (40,000$)</string>
  <string id="14623">I want to make a military contribution!</string>
  <string id="14615">Our tanks will go around the globe, you'll see, Carl!</string>
  <string id="14609">I like that you firmly believe in the strength of our army, Carl. Alas, things are not so bright…</string>
  <string id="14620">That is why the army needs such contributions.</string>
  <string id="14619">MAKE A STATE CONTRIBUTION (40,000$)</string>
  <string id="14617">I want to make a contribution to the needs of our great State!</string>
  <string id="14607">This is the right choice. With your help, the law in tarpaulin boots crush the revolutionary hydra!</string>
  <string id="14630">No doubt…</string>
  <string id="14625">GO BACK TO THE TALK LATER</string>
  <string id="14631">Great!</string>
  <string id="14603">I would like to make a personal contribution... ahem... to the favorable inspection results...</string>
  <string id="14612">Do not be ashamed of your weakness, Carl. We should admit our mistakes in time.</string>
  <string id="14598">I'll see what I can do for you personally. You see, the data on some violations can be lost.</string>
  <string id="14604">One hand washes another. But do not get it wrong! From this moment, Carl, you're working on me personally.</string>
  <string id="14626">I will do everything possible.</string>
  <string id="14618">REFUSE (follow the non-interference policy)</string>
  <string id="14606">This is your right, Carl! I hope that you will not be handcuffed at our next meeting.</string>
  <string id="14621">There are insufficient funds on your account, Carl.</string>

  <string id="14967">Big enough to hold... Hmmm... A human skeleton.</string>
  <string id="14968">A human skeleton?</string>
  <string id="14969">That's an unusual way of measuring volume. Lucky for you I have what you need.</string>
  <string id="14970">It will cost you $1,000. I'm giving you a discount because I like unusual requests.</string>
  <string id="14971">Come back tomorrow.</string>
  <string id="14972">Please bring the biggest one you can find.</string>
  <string id="14973">That'll be $2,000. Come back tomorrow.</string>
  <string id="14974">BUY THE SUITCASE (-$1,000)</string>
  <string id="14975">Here's your money. Now give me the suitcase!</string>
  <string id="14976">Here's the suitcase for that lonely skeleton.</string>
  <string id="14977">This is my final price. I'm already giving you a discount.</string>
  <string id="14978">Come back when you have enough money.</string>
  <string id="14979">BUY SUITCASE (-$2,000)</string>
  <string id="14980">Here's your super-sized suitcase.</string>
  <string id="14981">Can you give me the suitcase now and accept payment later?</string>
  <string id="14982">I'm sorry, Hector, but no. If I did that, my little enterprise would've gone belly-up by now.</string>
  <string id="14983">ASK ABOUT A PIRATE COSTUME</string>
  <string id="14984">I have an unusual request. I need a pirate costume.</string>
  <string id="14985">Can you get one for me?</string>
  <string id="14986">Unfortunately, I don't have any.</string>
  <string id="14987">However, the pawnshop owner down the block has been trying to sell his parrot for several months.</string>
  <string id="14988">That's a brilliant idea! Every pirate needs a parrot!</string>
  <string id="14989">Okay, I'll try to get the bird, but it will cost you.</string>
  <string id="14990">There's the price of the bird, the small matter of my commission, the illegal pets fee - you know, the usual stuff...</string>
  <string id="14991">That's what doing business with you is like, Nathan.</string>
  <string id="14992">Actually, that's life in this great and glorious state.</string>
  <string id="14993">BUY THE PARROT (-$5,000)</string>
  <string id="14994">Do you have the parrot? I'm ready to pay!</string>
  <string id="14995">I do! Introducing Beau Joe. Treat him well!</string>
  <string id="14996">Can you give me the parrot now and accept payment later?</string>
  <string id="14997">I can't, Hector. That's not even my parrot!</string>
  <string id="14998">ASK FOR INFO</string>
  <string id="14999">Hello, Nathan. Can you find out where they took Manishek's kid? He's in an orphanage, but which one?</string>
  <string id="15000">You said you sell information, too.</string>
  <string id="15001">You have a great memory for an 85-year-old, Hector!</string>
  <string id="15002">How did you know?</string>
  <string id="15003">About you being 85? Or about you not really being 85?</string>
  <string id="15004">Ahhh... I see what you're doing. You're showing me that you do know things, and are able to sell information. Clever.</string>
  <string id="15005">Bingo again, my friend.</string>
  <string id="15006">There's one thing I don't understand, Hector. Pretty soon, you'll be taken to the Euthanasia Center.</string>
  <string id="15007">So why are you trying to help people?</string>
  <string id="15008">Soon, nothing you've done will be of any consequence to you, so why do it?</string>
  <string id="15009">Because it matters to me here and now.</string>
  <string id="15010">Settling up with your conscience before accepting the inevitable?</string>
  <string id="15011">Let's cut to the chase, Nathan.</string>
  <string id="15012">Can you find out where they took Manishek's kid? I need to know the name of the orphanage. It's urgent.</string>
  <string id="15013">For $500, yes.</string>
  <string id="15014">FIND OUT WHERE THE CHILD IS (-$500)</string>
  <string id="15015">Did you find the kid?</string>
  <string id="15016">Yes. He was taken from the hospital to Orphanage No. 9. It's outside the city limits.</string>
  <string id="15017">It used to be a foundry - Workshop No. 3. When the Ministry shut it down, they turned it into living quarters.</string>
  <string id="15018">Money first; info second.</string>
  <string id="15019">ASK ABOUT A SAFE PLACE</string>
  <string id="15020">Nathan, one of my tenants is in big trouble. You must've heard of the genetic purification initiative...</string>
  <string id="15021">I did. Are they on the list?</string>
  <string id="15022">Yes...</string>
  <string id="15023">We need to hide a woman and a child. Can you help?</string>
  <string id="15024">It would be complicated and risky.</string>
  <string id="15025">Let me think...</string>
  <string id="15026">Have them call 379-974.</string>
  <string id="15027">Tell them dealing with those people will cost them dearly - perhaps too dearly.</string>
  <string id="15028">Those are terrifying people, my friend. I'd steer clear of them if I were you.</string>
  <string id="15029">But they're good at hiding folks.</string>
  <string id="15030">Thanks.</string>
  <string id="15031">Don't thank me. That's not the kind of connection for which one should be grateful.</string>
  <string id="15032">Once again, I urge you to stay away from them.</string>
  <string id="15033">TALK ABOUT MANISHEK'S FAMILY</string>
  <string id="15034">What happened, Nathan. Did you help them?</string>
  <string id="15035">I gave Louisa Manishek a choice and then introduced her to the right people. She agreed to their terms without thinking it through. It's unfortunate.</string>
  <string id="15036">When you strike a deal with the devil, it's wise to count your fingers.</string>
  <string id="15037">Then your extremities. And then your relatives.</string>
  <string id="15038">That sounds horrible!</string>
  <string id="15039">Hector, life is a deal with the devil someone struck before we were born.</string>
  <string id="15040">"Horrible" is our norm.</string>
  <string id="15041">What Manishek told me is unbelievable! They're holding his family captive!</string>
  <string id="15042">These people are making him do awful things!</string>
  <string id="15043">I told you they were dangerous people.</string>
  <string id="15044">Captivity isn't so bad. No one will find you, so you won't be sent to jail or locked up in a mental ward.</string>
  <string id="15045">Isn't that what your friend wanted?</string>
  <string id="15046">Damn! I wanted to help! To make it better!</string>
  <string id="15047">The road to hell is paved with good intentions. Our Great State cares for its citizens and assures their safety.</string>
  <string id="15048">All we can do is adapt or perish...</string>
  <string id="15049">To hell with your philosophy, Nathan! Is there nothing we can do?</string>
  <string id="15050">There's nothing I can do. I'm just a street merchant - a nobody.</string>
  <string id="15051">And Jacob is their fat milking cow. I doubt they'll ever let him off the hook.</string>
  <string id="15052">All you can do for his family now is stay out of his way and cover up for him - if you can.</string>
  <string id="15053">If he gets caught, his family is doomed.</string>
  <string id="15054">Damn it!</string>
  <string id="15055">END CONVERSATION</string>
  <string id="15056">Hello.</string>
  <string id="15057">RETURN THE GREETING</string>
  <string id="15058">Hello, Maria. You look great!</string>
  <string id="15059">Oh, thank you! And happy birthday, by the way.</string>
  <string id="15060">Well, thanks... Have you seen the news?</string>
  <string id="15061">Thanks, although between work, chores at home and taking care of my kid, I don't have the time to celebrate.</string>
  <string id="15062">I barely have time to watch "Patriots Cry, Too" on TV.</string>
  <string id="15063">Lucky you!</string>
  <string id="15064">ASK ABOUT HER FAMILY</string>
  <string id="15065">Tell me about your family.</string>
  <string id="15066">Klaus and I met at a charity reception hosted by the Ministry of Finance to support our soldiers.</string>
  <string id="15067">I brought the best students from our school to recite patriotic poems.</string>
  <string id="15068">Klaus helped me arrange everything. After that, we spent the whole night talking about literature! It was like in the movies - sparks were flying!</string>
  <string id="15069">Ours was lightning, actually!</string>
  <string id="15070">That sounds romantic.</string>
  <string id="15071">It was beautiful! I knew he'd make me happy. He's such a sensitive person!</string>
  <string id="15072">Only my daughter's birth was as important to me as meeting Klaus!</string>
  <string id="15073">We tried for years to have a baby, but couldn't.</string>
  <string id="15074">We were desperate, and clung to our last hope: treatment in Valverde. Back then, we could still leave the country legally.</string>
  <string id="15075">Klaus obtained permission through his connections at the Ministry.</string>
  <string id="15076">I'm glad it worked out. A child can brighten a colorless home.</string>
  <string id="15077">I felt that way when my son was born.</string>
  <string id="15078">Do you ever talk to him?</string>
  <string id="15079">He lives too far away. The letters I send him get lost on the way.</string>
  <string id="15080">What a shame.</string>
  <string id="15081">TALK ABOUT THE INFERTILITY PAPER</string>
  <string id="15082">Maria, this is none of my business, but I found out you're infertile.</string>
  <string id="15083">That's true. After Zlata, I haven't been able to...</string>
  <string id="15084">No, I mean genetically. You have never been able to bear a child...</string>
  <string id="15085">So where did Zlata come from?</string>
  <string id="15086">Hector, I have no idea how you found out, but you must keep that to yourself!</string>
  <string id="15087">We paid a dear price for Zlata! She's our daughter, even if she's not our blood!</string>
  <string id="15088">I'll do anything for her. Anything! Do you hear me?</string>
  <string id="15089">I hear you, Maria.</string>
  <string id="15090">I beg you, Hector, please, don't tell anyone!</string>
  <string id="15091">ASK WHAT SHE WANTS</string>
  <string id="15092">Dear Hector, I have a request for you - a small one. Do you happen to have a ball?</string>
  <string id="15093">A ball? The kind kids play with? Sorry, but my son has outgrown those kinds of toys. We donated everything to the nearby orphanage.</string>
  <string id="15094">I don't mean to be a bother, but could you ask the neighbors? I doubt they'll say no to the manager.</string>
  <string id="15095">Sure. I'd be glad to help.</string>
  <string id="15096">TALK ABOUT THE ACCIDENT</string>
  <string id="15097">Maria, I heard your daughter was run over. That's terrible! How is she?</string>
  <string id="15098">Not well, but I'm positive Klaus will find the money we need to pay for her surgery.</string>
  <string id="15099">I don't even want to think about him failing!</string>
  <string id="15100">DISCUSS ZLATA'S CONDITION</string>
  <string id="15101">How is she doing?</string>
  <string id="15102">She's in critical condition. She needs a bone marrow transplant.</string>
  <string id="15103">I'm feel lost, Hector, like I'm in a dream. It's as though nothing is real.</string>
  <string id="15104">I don't remember if you know or not, but Zlata's our daughter - our precious little girl.</string>
  <string id="15105">But we're not her biological parents, so we can't be donors; only her closest relatives will work.</string>
  <string id="15106">Can I help you?</string>
  <string id="15107">I'm not sure, but it's worth a shot. Could you try to find her real parents?</string>
  <string id="15108">Perhaps you know some officials who might have that information? Please, talk to my husband, if you haven't already.</string>
  <string id="15109">I'll see what I can do, Maria.</string>
  <string id="15110">She's in critical condition and needs a donor asap... Her organs are failing because she's not producing enough blood.</string>
  <string id="15111">I'm no expert, but don't they transplant marrow only after radiotherapy?</string>
  <string id="15112">I don't know, Hector. The nurse said the car that hit Zlata was transporting something. It must have been something secret.</string>
  <string id="15113">Something radioactive?</string>
  <string id="15114">How's Zlata doing?</string>
  <string id="15115">She... She passed...</string>
  <string id="15116">Oh, no, no, no!</string>
  <string id="15117">...</string>
  <string id="15118">Maria, please, talk to me. How can I help you? Would you like some water?</string>
  <string id="15119">What? Oh, it's you, Hector. Sorry, what were you saying?</string>
  <string id="15120">Yes, Maria. What can I do to help you?</string>
  <string id="15121">What can anyone do? Zlata, my baby girl...</string>
  <string id="15122">DISCUSS FUTURE PLANS</string>
  <string id="15123">What are you going to do now?</string>
  <string id="15124">We need to cure our girl - by hook or by crook.</string>
  <string id="15125">I feel like I'll die if we fail.</string>
  <string id="15126">TELL HER ABOUT BRUNO HEMPF'S PROPOSAL</string>
  <string id="15127">I have something to tell you, Maria, but I don't know how...</string>
  <string id="15128">Did you find Zlata's parents?</string>
  <string id="15129">No, but I'm getting close. There's a problem, though. Bruno Hempf has the information we need, but he wants you to pay for it.</string>
  <string id="15130">How much does he want?</string>
  <string id="15131">It's not a matter of how much, it's a matter of what. I can't even think of a way to tell you this, you being a lady and all...</string>
  <string id="15132">He... Well...</string>
  <string id="15133">Say no more. I know what you mean. What else could we possibly expect from that lustful jerk!</string>
  <string id="15134">He wants to get laid, like last time.</string>
  <string id="15135">Well, in general, you're right...</string>
  <string id="15136">Don't look at me like that, Hector! The last time, I had to - for Klaus!</string>
  <string id="15137">I couldn't stand to see him withering anymore, aching so badly to have a child. I didn't want our marriage to fall apart...</string>
  <string id="15138">And that fat bastard started groping me at that charity reception where Klaus and I met! I hate that swine!</string>
  <string id="15139">Oh, how ecstatic he was when I came to him begging for help! His cheeks were flapping in anticipation!</string>
  <string id="15140">Maria, you don't have to tell me...</string>
  <string id="15141">Shut up, Hector! Zlata's presence in our lives has cleansed me of every speck of dirt that soiled me as I did what I had to do.</string>
  <string id="15142">Love erases every sin committed for the good of a child, including both past and future transgressions!</string>
  <string id="15143">Tell Hempf I will do what he wants.</string>
  <string id="15144">I ask just one more thing of you, Hector. Please don't tell my husband about this. He's far too sensitive to survive it.</string>
  <string id="15145">He wants money. Lots and lots of money.</string>
  <string id="15146">Oh... Talk with Klaus. I'm sure he'll come up with whatever is needed.</string>
  <string id="15147">Our daughter is more important than money.</string>
  <string id="15148">DISCUSS BRUNO HEMPF'S PROPOSAL</string>
  <string id="15149">This isn't the first time you've had to do this?</string>
  <string id="15150">That's none of your concern. I'd do anything to save my daughter.</string>
  <string id="15152">Hector! Why did you tell Klaus about Bruno's proposal?!</string>
  <string id="15153">He's furious! He said he'll leave me if I give Bruno what he wants!</string>
  <string id="15154">I'm sorry, Maria, but I couldn't keep that from him.</string>
  <string id="15155">As disgusting as it is, it was an easy way to find out about Zlata's parents!</string>
  <string id="15156">What am I supposed to do now?</string>
  <string id="15157">I'll think of something.</string>
  <string id="15158">He wants his nephew to replace your husband at the Ministry.</string>
  <string id="15159">He wants Klaus to quit.</string>
  <string id="15160">I'm sure Klaus can find similar work... Did you talk with him already? If not, please do. Tell him everything.</string>
  <string id="15161">My husband knows what to do!</string>
  <string id="15162">DISCUSS ZLATA'S REAL PARENTS</string>
  <string id="15163">I pray they're still alive - either of them!</string>
  <string id="15164">Let them be alive and well!</string>
  <string id="15165">Finding them will be half the battle. We'll also have to convince them to become donors.</string>
  <string id="15166">I'll beg on my knees. I'll do anything they want as long as my baby is saved!</string>
  <string id="15167">I have the information you need! Zlata's biological parents are Jacob and Louisa Manishek.</string>
  <string id="15168">What a coincidence!</string>
  <string id="15169">My prayers were answered! They're not just alive and well, they're our neighbors!</string>
  <string id="15170">I hope they'll be willing to save our girl... Klaus will talk with them.</string>
  <string id="15171">Thank you, Hector!</string>
  <string id="15172">DISCUSS DONATING BLOOD</string>
  <string id="15173">This is madness! I don't understand the reason behind all of these inspections!</string>
  <string id="15174">We live in astonishing times. Sometimes, I think things couldn't possibly get worse...</string>
  <string id="15175">Then the Ministry issues a new directive, and I see that I was wrong. It can always get worse - far worse!</string>
  <string id="15176">DISCUSS WAR</string>
  <string id="15177">I hope the war will be over soon...</string>
  <string id="15178">DISCUSS THE MANISHEKS</string>
  <string id="15179">I don't know how I would respond to a request to donate blood for a long-deceased daughter...</string>
  <string id="15180">I just hope they'll say yes. This is Zlata's only chance.</string>
  <string id="15181">DISCUSS ZLATA AND LOUISA MANISHEK</string>
  <string id="15182">Have you heard about Louisa taking Zlata?</string>
  <string id="15183">I'm torn to pieces! On one hand, I'm happy Zlata is alive and well...</string>
  <string id="15184">On the other, I'm furious at Louisa! How could she abduct my child?</string>
  <string id="15185">She's her mother, just like you are. What would you do in her shoes?</string>
  <string id="15186">I didn't say I don't understand her. But I'm still mad!</string>
  <string id="15187">I miss my baby so much... I wish they'd find her and bring her home!</string>
  <string id="15188">DISCUSS LOUISA MANISHEK AND ZLATA'S DEATHS</string>
  <string id="15189">Maria, I'm very sorry for your loss...</string>
  <string id="15190">I can't believe Zlata is gone... This is wrong... So wrong... I don't know how to deal with it.</string>
  <string id="15191">As for Louisa, I'll pray for her. She was only trying to save her daughter... My daughter... OUR daughter!</string>
  <string id="15192">I'd give my life to bring Zlata back!</string>
  <string id="15193">END CONVERSATION</string>
  <string id="19036">ASK ABOUT KNOWING BRUNO HEMPF</string>
  <string id="19037">Do you know Bruno Hempf, Maria?</string>
  <string id="19038">Why do you ask?</string>
  <string id="19039">He's my boss, and he…mentioned you.</string>
  <string id="19040">I see… I'd change the subject, if you don't mind.</string>
  <string id="19041">I'd rather forget the circumstances of our meeting.</string>
  <string id="19042">ASK WHAT SHE WANTS</string>
  <string id="19043">Did you want something?</string>
  <string id="19044">Hector, we've got enough on our plates as it is; now there's bed bugs in the apartment!</string>
  <string id="19045">SELL THE CHEMICAL (-250 reputation points)</string>
  <string id="19046">I have a great spray for that! It's only $500.</string>
  <string id="19047">Okay, I'll take it.</string>
  <string id="19048">You've got to do that for free, Hector! That's your job!</string>
  <string id="19049">CALM DOWN</string>
  <string id="19050">Are you sure? Where could they possibly come from?</string>
  <string id="19051">I'm sure.</string>
  <string id="19052">OK, Maria, I'll see what I can do.</string>
  <string id="19316">He'll be waiting for you in the same place he was last time.</string>
  <string id="19395">ASK FOR ZLATA'S DNA</string>
  <string id="19396">Maria, as you know, Klaus asked me to find Zlata's biological parents.</string>
  <string id="19397">I need something with her DNA. Nowadays, scientific progress makes it possible to compare the samples with the database.</string>
  <string id="19398">Oh, right, Klaus mentioned this. Will that lollipop do? She's been shewing on it the day before.</string>
  <string id="19399">Sorry, Hector, I can't help crying…</string>
  <string id="19688">TALK ABOUT THE BEDBUGS</string>
  <string id="19689">Can you exterminate them?</string>
  <string id="15310">Hello.</string>
  <string id="15311">GREET KLAUS</string>
  <string id="15312">Hello, Klaus. How are you?</string>
  <string id="15313">Fine. And you?</string>
  <string id="15314">I wish I could say happy birthday, Hector, but given the latest news, you simply have my deepest condolences.</string>
  <string id="15315">I never would've guessed you were 85. You look much younger!</string>
  <string id="15316">The problem, Klaus, is that I'm not even 65!</string>
  <string id="15317">What? But... How was I wrong?</string>
  <string id="15318">You weren't wrong, Klaus. The Ministry is.</string>
  <string id="15319">Oh! So they'll fix their records, and you'll have plenty of time before having to visit the horrid Euthanasia Center!</string>
  <string id="15320">Who knows? Maybe it won't even be around in a few years. I'm sure this is a temporary measure!</string>
  <string id="15321">There's nothing more permanent in our world than temporary solutions.</string>
  <string id="15322">The Ministry of Care called. They think their records are correct.</string>
  <string id="15323">And even if they realized they made a mistake, no one would admit it...</string>
  <string id="15324">Because the Great State and the Wise Leader don't err... My God, Hector, I'm sorry!</string>
  <string id="15325">Don't worry about it. It's my life, and my problem. You've got enough on your own plate.</string>
  <string id="15326">All we can do is pray nobody in the Ministry spills coffee on the records that show your age, or the ages of your children.</string>
  <string id="15327">ASK ABOUT THE BUILDING</string>
  <string id="15328">I know this building used to belong to your family. What was it like?</string>
  <string id="15329">It didn't just belong to my family - my great-grandfather and his son built it!</string>
  <string id="15330">It was so beautiful in its prime! I remember orange trees blooming in the orchard...</string>
  <string id="15331">Alas, there's nothing left of its former beauty. The Ministry long ago turned the orchards into tarmac.</string>
  <string id="15332">ASK ABOUT THE WEATHER</string>
  <string id="15333">How's the weather?</string>
  <string id="15334">Terrible! I haven't seen the sun for weeks.</string>
  <string id="15335">That kind of mirrors our lives, doesn't it?</string>
  <string id="15336">ASK ABOUT HIS FAMILY</string>
  <string id="15337">Tell me about your family, Klaus.</string>
  <string id="15338">As you know, my wife's name is Maria. She's a literature teacher. Our daughter, Zlata, is six. We're already looking for a school for her.</string>
  <string id="15339">That said, the Ministry might implement mandatory allocation, which means she'd probably go to the nearest School of Patriotic Upbringing.</string>
  <string id="15340">I don't have any other family. At least no one who's not in jail.</string>
  <string id="15341">I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.</string>
  <string id="15342">Ahhh... I'm an economist at the Ministry of Finance. I have access to a variety of statistics.</string>
  <string id="15343">It's been noted recently that every citizen has a relative who's in jail...</string>
  <string id="15344">...or in a labor camp, or who's been executed.</string>
  <string id="15345">By the way, the department that made the discovery was disbanded and everyone went to jail - except for the supervisor. I think he's related to someone important.</string>
  <string id="15346">And you, Hector? Do you have any family?</string>
  <string id="15347">Yes, I have an adult son, but he lives far away. He's helping to build a railroad up north.</string>
  <string id="15348">It takes six months for mail to reach him, provided it doesn't get lost along the way. I don't get to hear from him much.</string>
  <string id="15349">But at least he's alive and not in jail.</string>
  <string id="15350">I'm glad for that.</string>
  <string id="15351">ASK ABOUT HIS WORK</string>
  <string id="15352">Are you an economist?</string>
  <string id="15353">Yes, and a good one at that. I've loved numbers since I was kid. It's the perfect job for me!</string>
  <string id="15354">Though I sometimes catch myself thinking that people are skeptical about the statistical data I compile.</string>
  <string id="15355">What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="15356">Did you know, Hector, that for each newborn, four soldiers are killed in action?</string>
  <string id="15357">Or that our economy is based on the support of the Ministry and satellite service jobs?</string>
  <string id="15358">These people produce nothing but new laws and directives. I say this, even though I myself am employed by the Ministry!</string>
  <string id="15359">Or how about this: 30 percent of our workforce is in jail, and another 10 percent is busy guarding those jails...</string>
  <string id="15360">Klaus, there was a time when I'd just nod and go record that information.</string>
  <string id="15361">But now... I don't think I'll be around for more than a couple of weeks. So let me give you some advice...</string>
  <string id="15362">Never share that information with anyone. If you do, they'll come for you.</string>
  <string id="15363">Oh, my... I didn't realize...</string>
  <string id="15364">You've heard enough. I understand. Keep it to yourself, and everything will be fine.</string>
  <string id="15365">ASK WHAT HE WANTS</string>
  <string id="15366">Do you want something?</string>
  <string id="15367">I would like to me a request, if I may.</string>
  <string id="15368">Go ahead.</string>
  <string id="15369">Zlata will soon turn six. I'd like to throw her a party!</string>
  <string id="15370">Ever since she saw the fireworks on the Day of World Happiness, she won't stop talking about seeing more!</string>
  <string id="15371">Can you acquire some for her?</string>
  <string id="15372">I'll see what I can do.</string>
  <string id="15373">DELIVER THE FIREWORKS</string>
  <string id="15374">Here you go! Please be careful!</string>
  <string id="15375">I hope the quality is good.</string>
  <string id="15376">Unbelievable! You got them!</string>
  <string id="15377">Thank you, Hector!</string>
  <string id="15378">I'm still working on it...</string>
  <string id="15379">You know the Ministry only recently lifted the ban on fireworks.</string>
  <string id="15380">DISCUSS HIS WIFE'S INFERTILITY</string>
  <string id="15381">Klaus, I found out Zlata isn't your biological child...</string>
  <string id="15382">Hector, out of respect for your age, I won't raise my voice at you...</string>
  <string id="15383">But I will ask you to mind your own business! She means as much to us as any child would to his or her biological parents! We tried for so long to have a child of our own...</string>
  <string id="15384">I don't want to even discuss that! Just forget it! Never mention it again!</string>
  <string id="15385">DISCUSS THE ACCIDENT</string>
  <string id="15386">I was sorry to hear about the car accident, Klaus! How is your daughter doing?</string>
  <string id="15387">She's in critical condition but there's a chance she'll survive. She needs a bone marrow transplant.</string>
  <string id="15388">We're raising the funds for her surgery now. As for a donor...</string>
  <string id="15392">DISCUSS ZLATA'S CONDITION</string>
  <string id="15393">How's Zlata doing?</string>
  <string id="15394">She's in critical condition. If only there was a one-in-a-million chance to find her real parents...</string>
  <string id="15395">I'd be grateful until the day I die, Hector.</string>
  <string id="15396">How's she doing?</string>
  <string id="15397">Not well. She needs a doctor ASAP...</string>
  <string id="15398">How's Zlata doing?</string>
  <string id="15399">She passed away. My God, it's unbearable! Parents should not have to bury their kids!</string>
  <string id="15400">I... I'm worried about Maria... She's on the brink of a nervous breakdown.</string>
  <string id="15401">ASK WHAT HE WANTS</string>
  <string id="15402">Did you hear that my daughter was hit by a car? It was such a tragedy.</string>
  <string id="15403">I need your help. She needs a bone marrow transplant from a donor. The doctors say only a blood relative would be an appropriate match.</string>
  <string id="15404">So what's the problem? Can't you do that for your child?</string>
  <string id="15405">Well, we adopted Zlata, and it wasn't completely legal.</string>
  <string id="15406">So we can't find her real parents through the usual channels.</string>
  <string id="15407">I had no idea! How can I help?</string>
  <string id="15408">If only you could use your connections to find her real parents...</string>
  <string id="15409">Your boss, Bruno Hempf, helped with the adoption. And now we can't get an appointment with him...</string>
  <string id="15410">I can't promise anything, Klaus, but I'll try.</string>
  <string id="15411">Did you know our daughter was hit by a car?</string>
  <string id="15412">I'm sorry for yelling at you. I need your help. She's our beloved child...</string>
  <string id="15413">If you could use your connections to find her real parents, then she might live.</string>
  <string id="15414">TELL HIM ABOUT BRUNO HEMPF'S PROPOSAL</string>
  <string id="15415">Do you have any news for me, Hector? Did you speak with Bruno?</string>
  <string id="15416">Yes, but you won't like what he's proposing...</string>
  <string id="15417">He won't give me the information for free.</string>
  <string id="15418">How much does he want?</string>
  <string id="15419">He doesn't want money.</string>
  <string id="15420">He wants a night with your wife...</string>
  <string id="15421">WHAT? How dare he! I'll kill that fat bastard! Maria won't do it! There must be another way! Is there?</string>
  <string id="15422">I'm sorry, Hector. I need to talk to my wife.</string>
  <string id="15423">Money! A lot of money! $150,000 to be exact!</string>
  <string id="15424">What? Is he insane? That damn greedy jerk! A child's life is at stake!</string>
  <string id="15425">Don't kill the messenger, Klaus.</string>
  <string id="15426">I'm sorry, Hector. I'm just shocked by the ease with which people will capitalize on the suffering of a child.</string>
  <string id="15427">I'll get the money. I think I can, anyway. Tell that fat bastard he'll have it by tomorrow.</string>
  <string id="15428">Be careful, Klaus.</string>
  <string id="15429">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="15430">It's over, Hector. I tried to steal the money at work, but I got caught.</string>
  <string id="15431">I told you to be careful! So how come you're not in jail?</string>
  <string id="15432">Thanks to my many years of service to the Ministry, I have a lot of connections. I called in a few favors.</string>
  <string id="15433">They covered up my crime, but I lost my job.</string>
  <string id="15435">All is not lost. Hempf won't mind that outcome.</string>
  <string id="15436">He wanted his nephew to take your job.</string>
  <string id="15438">THEN FIND OUT WHO ZLATA'S PARENTS ARE - ASAP!</string>
  <string id="15439">What does he want?</string>
  <string id="15440">He wants his nephew to have your job. If you quit, he'll give you the information you want.</string>
  <string id="15441">Damn! I know his nephew. He came to us a month ago looking for work.</string>
  <string id="15442">He'd be worthless as an economist! He can't add two and two!</string>
  <string id="15443">The Ministry of the Economy is awash with nepotism. No wonder our economy is sinking like a leaky boat.</string>
  <string id="15444">How am I supposed to provide for my family?</string>
  <string id="15445">Klaus, to even have a family to provide for, you must first save it.</string>
  <string id="15446">You're right, Hector! I'll find another job after we save Zlata.</string>
  <string id="15447">I'm ready to tell that leech I'll give up my job in exchange for the information I need.</string>
  <string id="15448">I'm sorry, Klaus...</string>
  <string id="15449">Don't apologize, Hector. You've already done more for us than all of the rest of the officials put together.</string>
  <string id="15450">TELL HIM WHO ZLATA'S REAL PARENTS ARE</string>
  <string id="15451">I have the information you need. Zlata's biological parents are Jacob and Louisa Manishek.</string>
  <string id="15452">But... How is that possible?</string>
  <string id="15453">The chances of living in the same house as them are infinitesimal. I could calculate them for you!</string>
  <string id="15454">What am I talking about? Once again, we're facing the impossible... Our daughter is the Manishek's deceased child...</string>
  <string id="15455">I'll go to him and tell him the truth.</string>
  <string id="15456">I hope they'll agree to help.</string>
  <string id="15457">Jacob Manishek listened to me tell him the story about Zlata and then told me to get the hell out of his apartment! Please, talk to him, or Zlata will die!</string>
  <string id="15458">We're counting the hours she has left to live!</string>
  <string id="15459">She needs a donor asap, but Manishek won't even listen to me...</string>
  <string id="15460">I'll try, Klaus.</string>
  <string id="15461">TALK ABOUT THE MANISHEKS</string>
  <string id="15462">I have mixed feelings, Hector...</string>
  <string id="15463">I'm sorry we obtained Zlata through the suffering of good people.</string>
  <string id="15464">But please understand - it's not like we took the child from them. She was issued to us legally...</string>
  <string id="15465">Issued? Like a bag of sugar?</string>
  <string id="15466">How was that legal?</string>
  <string id="15467">You're right. We had to, well, cut a few corners.</string>
  <string id="15468">But that was because we were so far down on the waiting list.</string>
  <string id="15469">If we had known they'd take Zlata from the Manisheks and tell them she died at birth, we never would have gone through with it.</string>
  <string id="15470">I don't think you're being completely honest, Klaus, not even with yourself.</string>
  <string id="15471">Then screw you! YES! We'd have taken her anyway!</string>
  <string id="15472">Zlata... She saved us... She saved our marriage... She gave us a purpose!</string>
  <string id="15473">I don't know how we could live without her.</string>
  <string id="15474">Go away, Hector.</string>
  <string id="15475">I'm furious! How could she?</string>
  <string id="15476">How could she save our daughter only to take her from us? We raised her! That's theft!</string>
  <string id="15477">I'm sorry to hear that, Klaus, but you sound like you bought Zlata in a store.</string>
  <string id="15478">Perhaps she'll be happy there...</string>
  <string id="15479">What are you saying, Hector?!</string>
  <string id="15480">How can our daughter be happy with a stranger?!</string>
  <string id="15481">Even though she's her biological mother, we are her parents!</string>
  <string id="15482">As for us, we'll be unhappy for the rest of our lives...</string>
  <string id="15483">DISCUSS LOUISA MANISHEK'S DEATH</string>
  <string id="15484">I don't know what to say... That's horrible...</string>
  <string id="15485">It's a real nightmare...</string>
  <string id="15486">TELL HIM ABOUT MARIA'S VISIT TO HEMPF</string>
  <string id="15487">I'm afraid I'm the bearer of bad news, Klaus.</string>
  <string id="15488">I was asked to keep it a secret, but out of respect for you, I can't.</string>
  <string id="15489">What happened?</string>
  <string id="15490">In exchange for the identity of Zlata's biological parents, Bruno is demanding that Maria sleep with him.</string>
  <string id="15491">Your wife went to Bruno Hempf to save your daughter.</string>
  <string id="15492">Are you insane? What are you talking about?!</string>
  <string id="15493">It's true. And it wasn't the first time, either.</string>
  <string id="15494">Maria did the same thing when you were trying to adopt a child so you wouldn't have to wait.</string>
  <string id="15495">Hector, I'm a decent person, so I won't strike an old man...</string>
  <string id="15496">But you'd better tell your doctor to change your medication because the pills you're taking are making you hallucinate.</string>
  <string id="15497">I'm out of here. And I have no desire to listen to that nonsense ever again!</string>
  <string id="15498">END THE CONVERSATION</string>
  <string id="19053">ASK ABOUT MONEY</string>
  <string id="19054">What's the best way to store a large amount of money, Klaus?</string>
  <string id="19055">I've no clue.</string>
  <string id="19056">I have no money, therefore no issues with storing it.</string>
  <string id="19325">ASK WHAT HAPPENED</string>
  <string id="19326">I gave him the money. Now it's your turn.</string>
  <string id="19432">I'm waiting for an official paper with the new appointment.</string>
  <string id="19433">Do you know, what is it?</string>
  <string id="19434">No, but I'm a good expert, I don't think that would be a problem.</string>
  <string id="19435">The Ministry of Allocation said, since I'm an economist, I will be good at counting money.</string>
  <string id="19436">Perhaps, they have a spot at the Treasury.</string>
  <string id="15566">
  </string>
  <string id="15567">
  </string>
  <string id="15568">
  </string>
  <string id="15601">ASK HIM WHAT HE WANTS</string>
  <string id="15602">Comrade Hempf? What brings you here?</string>
  <string id="15603">A matter of urgent importance. A complaint we can't leave unattended.</string>
  <string id="15604">The Manisheks... They're neglecting their son... What's his name?</string>
  <string id="15605">Marcus?</string>
  <string id="15606">Yeah, him. The police found him heading to the hospital to save some girl.</string>
  <string id="15607">Who gave him the idea to run away?</string>
  <string id="15608">No one...</string>
  <string id="15609">That's unfortunate, comrade Hector. As the manager of this building, you should be aware of everything that's happening within it!</string>
  <string id="15610">It doesn't matter now, though.</string>
  <string id="15611">I'm here to tell his mother we're depriving her of custody and sending the boy to an orphanage.</string>
  <string id="15612">As for you, mind your own business and get back to work.</string>
  <string id="15613">TALK ABOUT AVOIDING EUTHANASIA</string>
  <string id="15614">Comrade Hempf, are there ways to avoid the Blissful Sleep procedure?</string>
  <string id="15615">I'm sure there are precedents.</string>
  <string id="15616">Hector Medina, you sly fox. Do you think it's that easy to turn the wheel of fate?</string>
  <string id="15617">What can you give to our Great State if not your life? What will you live for?</string>
  <string id="15618">I have a son. I'd give anything to see him again.</string>
  <string id="15619">Anything? Okay, what do you have?</string>
  <string id="15620">I could get some money...</string>
  <string id="15621">I could find a place at the Ministry Archive for you.</string>
  <string id="15622">However, special conditions are placed on anyone who works there. You can never leave the building or retire - ever. So you won't be able to see your son.</string>
  <string id="15623">Okay, Medina. The state needs financing in order to support the high living standards of its citizens.</string>
  <string id="15624">I'll make an exception for you. Bring me $100,000, and someone else will receive the Blissful Sleep treatment in your place.</string>
  <string id="15625">END THE CONVERSATION</string>
  <string id="19028">PAY TO NOT GET EUTHANIZED</string>
  <string id="19029">Comrade Hempf, I brought you money. Do you remember our agreement?</string>
  <string id="19030">Yeah. Money for the lost sleep, so to say…</string>
  <string id="19031">Give it here, Hector. I found a place for you. Hope you like paper.</string>
  <string id="19032">A police squad will come for you in due time. Don't worry, it's a formality.</string>
  <string id="19033">Will they beat me up?</string>
  <string id="19034">They won't do anything you couldn't survive.</string>
  <string id="19035">See you later, Hector.</string>
  <string id="19370">GIVE ABSENTEE BALLOT</string>
  <string id="19371">I brought you the paper you've been asking for.</string>
  <string id="19372">Good, Hector. You're living up to my expectations… so far.</string>
  <string id="19373">What will happen to Klaus Schimmer now?</string>
  <string id="19374">He won't be able to leave the city. I want him to stay in Hellmer until I figure out what to do with him.</string>
  <string id="19375">Klaus established some ties at his workplace; I need him close by until I deal with those ties.</string>
  <string id="19376">Sounds threatening!</string>
  <string id="19377">What do you care? Don't you have enough of your own problems, Hector?</string>
  <string id="19394">If you don't want to wait, call the Euthanasia Center. That's one of the few state offices where there's actually no line to get an appointment.</string>
  <string id="15843">Hello.</string>
  <string id="15844">SAY HELLO</string>
  <string id="15845">Hello, Hector. Do you want something?</string>
  <string id="15846">I'm just saying hi.</string>
  <string id="15847">Thanks! Do you know if there's a good toy store in the city?</string>
  <string id="15848">Marcus' birthday is coming up, and all they have at the general store are wooden toys.</string>
  <string id="15849">He really wants a rocket!</string>
  <string id="15850">I'm afraid we don't have any toy stores.</string>
  <string id="15851">Oh well. I guess I'll go back to the general store and pick something else.</string>
  <string id="15852">You know, Jacob, they say wooden toys are safe. They're made of all-natural materials and they don't contain allergens.</string>
  <string id="15853">All-natural materials? Yeah, right. Last winter, a buddy of mine ran out of coal and started to get cold...</string>
  <string id="15854">He had to use any fuel he could find, even furniture.</string>
  <string id="15855">Despite their son's tears, they had to burn his wooden horse, too.</string>
  <string id="15856">That horse burned for eight days! Can you imagine that?</string>
  <string id="15857">Eight days instead of one? That sounds like a holiday miracle!</string>
  <string id="15858">Huh! As a chemist, I assure you that sounds like a devilish concoction of paraffines!</string>
  <string id="15859">I doubt it's healthy for kids.</string>
  <string id="15860">But it sounds like those wooden horses could come in handy in the winter...</string>
  <string id="15861">Perhaps you're right.</string>
  <string id="15862">DISCUSS ZLATA</string>
  <string id="15863">Jacob, we need to talk.</string>
  <string id="15864">It's a touchy subject concerning your family.</string>
  <string id="15865">I'm all ears.</string>
  <string id="15866">Don't ask me how I know, but your daughter - the child the Ministry said died at birth...</string>
  <string id="15867">She's alive...</string>
  <string id="15868">What?! How is that possible?!</string>
  <string id="15869">I don't know if the hospital made a mistake or someone did something underhanded, but it's true...</string>
  <string id="15870">Your daughter is alive. And another family adopted her.</string>
  <string id="15872">In what can only be an incredible coincidence, she lives in our building. Her name is Zlata Schimmer.</string>
  <string id="15873">What should we do?!</string>
  <string id="15874">I'm not much good in matters like these, but I believe you shouldn't act hastily.</string>
  <string id="15875">If I were you, I'd take some time to think things over...</string>
  <string id="15876">You're right. I need to digest this first...</string>
  <string id="15877">I can't believe Zlata is our girl! That's why she always reminded me of Louisa when she was young...</string>
  <string id="15878">My wife and I met as kids. We lived next door to each other, went to the same school...</string>
  <string id="15879">I hope you're able to keep a level head about all of this, Jacob.</string>
  <string id="15880">Don't worry! I'm not planning to make a scene or somehow traumatize the child.</string>
  <string id="15881">She has parents and loves them... You're right: this is a very touchy matter.</string>
  <string id="15882">DISCUSS BECOMING A DONOR FOR ZLATA</string>
  <string id="15883">Have you talked with your wife, Jacob? Why don't you want her to become a donor?</string>
  <string id="15884">I did. But I'm sorry - I can't risk her life. I wish I could be a donor...</string>
  <string id="15885">I just can't risk losing Louisa.</string>
  <string id="15886">We both know what's going on in the hospitals nowadays. The risk of her not surviving the surgery is high.</string>
  <string id="15887">Marcus wouldn't survive his mom's death! Neither would I...</string>
  <string id="15888">Tell Klaus I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="15889">But you have the ability to save a life! Zlata is your daughter!</string>
  <string id="15890">We buried her years ago and dedicated our lives to Marcus.</string>
  <string id="15891">She was put into the hands of other people, and as good as they were, they couldn't keep her safe! And now they're trying to make us pay!</string>
  <string id="15892">Still, Jacob, this is the life of a child! They have no other options.</string>
  <string id="15893">Let it go! I won't let my wife donate - period.</string>
  <string id="15894">ASK WHAT HAPPENED</string>
  <string id="15895">Jacob! You're back?! What happened?</string>
  <string id="15896">Yes, I'm back. It was just a silly mistake.</string>
  <string id="15897">They locked me up without an explanation.</string>
  <string id="15898">It looks like someone set me up.</string>
  <string id="15899">Set you up?</string>
  <string id="15900">I overheard them mention a report. So they arrested me until they checked it out.</string>
  <string id="15901">It turned out to be a lie. I wish I knew who wrote the report! I got fired!</string>
  <string id="15902">Jacob, I need to tell you something...</string>
  <string id="15903">And there was no reason to fire me! They called it a preventative measure! Nobody gets reported for nothing! Bastards!</string>
  <string id="15904">Jacob, I...</string>
  <string id="15905">How am I supposed to put food on the table now?!</string>
  <string id="15906">Jacob!!! Listen to me!!!</string>
  <string id="15907">WHAT?!</string>
  <string id="15908">You need to calm down. While you were away, Louisa... She went to the hospital... She didn't make it through the surgery, and neither did Zlata.</string>
  <string id="15909">I'm sorry, but they're gone...</string>
  <string id="15910">WHAT?! How could she have done that? I told her it was risky! Oh my God... This is a nightmare... Please, God, wake me up...</string>
  <string id="15911">Louisa! My Louisa! I can't believe this...</string>
  <string id="15912">...</string>
  <string id="15913">And Marcus? Where's my son?! Answer me!!!</string>
  <string id="15914">The Ministry took him to an orphanage..</string>
  <string id="15915">Which orphanage? I'm still alive, and I'm not in prison! How dare they take him away! I must find him!</string>
  <string id="15916">Comrade Hempf said you can't see him again because your loyalty index is zero.</string>
  <string id="15917">I'm sorry, but they took away your custody rights...</string>
  <string id="15918">NOOO!!! Damn you! Damn all of you freaking Ministry rats! Burn in hell!</string>
  <string id="15919">Jacob, if there's anything...</string>
  <string id="15920">You go to hell, too! I've lost everything! Absolutely everything! In one day!</string>
  <string id="15921">Stay away from me, Hector. I mean it! Stay away!!!</string>
  <string id="15923">Hector! Have you seen my wife and son? Why is our apartment empty? What happened? Talk to me!</string>
  <string id="15924">Calm down, Jacob, I'll tell you.</string>
  <string id="15925">Louisa left.</string>
  <string id="15926">Left? Where did she go?</string>
  <string id="15927">She's going to abduct your son from the orphanage. You and Louisa have lost custody...</string>
  <string id="15928">Will she be back? What did she say?</string>
  <string id="15929">I'm afraid not. She doesn't want you to look for her. I don't know where she's planning to go next...</string>
  <string id="15930">What? Why?!</string>
  <string id="15931">I think Louisa blames you for Zlata's death...</string>
  <string id="15932">Damn it! I just wanted to do what was best for my family... What should I do now? Actually, what's the point of anything? My family - my whole life - is gone.</string>
  <string id="15934">What do you mean she left? Where did she go? And where's Marcus?</string>
  <string id="15935">She took Marcus with her.</string>
  <string id="15936">She doesn't want you to look for her. I don't know where she's planning to go next...</string>
  <string id="15938">Calm down! While you were away, Louisa went to the hospital for the surgery...</string>
  <string id="15939">Damn it! Is she OK?</string>
  <string id="15940">Yes, the surgery went well. Louisa and Zlata both made it. But I'm afraid I have some bad news...</string>
  <string id="15941">Left? To go where? When will she be back? And where's Marcus?</string>
  <string id="15942">She took both kids. And she doesn't want you to look for her.</string>
  <string id="15943">She took our kids? That's called kidnapping!</string>
  <string id="15944">She can't forgive you for refusing to help Zlata. She said, "He refused to save his own child. I can't stay with him."</string>
  <string id="15945">That's what she said, verbatim. I'm sorry, Jacob.</string>
  <string id="15946">DISCUSS THE WEATHER</string>
  <string id="15947">What do you think about the weather?</string>
  <string id="15948">What weather, Hector? Look outside! It's nasty and gray, like it always is...</string>
  <string id="15949">That goddamn smoke from the factory won't let any sunlight through. The coal dust doesn't help, either.</string>
  <string id="15950">DISCUSS EUTHANASIA</string>
  <string id="15951">Have you heard of the Blissful Sleep?</string>
  <string id="15952">Yes. Don't tell anyone, but I think it's pure madness.</string>
  <string id="15953">Do you think it's...painful?</string>
  <string id="15954">It should be! Just imagine: a man spends his life slaving away for his people and state.</string>
  <string id="15955">And instead of well-deserved respect and retirement, he gets shot up with poison!</string>
  <string id="15956">Besides, given how they deal with things, I doubt they have any decent medications left.</string>
  <string id="15957">I wouldn't be surprised to hear that instead of a fast and painless procedure, it takes old people hours to die in agony!</string>
  <string id="15958">Oh, my, Hector! I'm sorry! I heard about your birthday, but it didn't compute...</string>
  <string id="15959">All the news on the TV seems to be about things that are happening far away - things that don't concern us or our loved ones...</string>
  <string id="15960">I wish I could help you, but how...</string>
  <string id="15961">It's OK, Jacob. I'll deal with it.</string>
  <string id="15962">END THE CONVERSATION</string>
  <string id="16400">Jacob! You're back!</string>
  <string id="16401">Yes, I am. What happened, Hector? Where are Marcus and Louisa?!</string>
  <string id="16402">While you were away, they had to find a way to escape the police. It's all because of the blood transfusion stations.</string>
  <string id="16403">Oh, no! Did they have to take blood tests?</string>
  <string id="16404">As far as I know, you forbid them to do that.</string>
  <string id="16405">Exactly! I took our samples myself and secretly checked them in a biolab where a friend works...</string>
  <string id="16406">I found the Traitor's Gene in Louisa and Marcus' samples. They wouldn't pass the tests and would be sent to the labor camp for traitors.</string>
  <string id="16407">What jerk decided to measure patriotism on a genetic level? That's not science, it's bigotry!</string>
  <string id="16408">All I know is a phone number: 379-974.</string>
  <string id="16409">I think the people who hid your family would ask for something in return.</string>
  <string id="16410">They can have whatever they want! Thank God they're safe! I need to do call them now. Thanks, Hector!</string>
  <string id="16411">ASK ABOUT Louisa AND MARCUS</string>
  <string id="16412">Did you find out where your wife and son hid?</string>
  <string id="16413">Yes, but it didn't make my life any easier. They were captured, Hector!</string>
  <string id="16414">Those rascals are holding them hostage!</string>
  <string id="16415">My God! What do they want?</string>
  <string id="16416">I don't know... I was told to sit still and wait for a call.</string>
  <string id="16417">I can't call the police because the first thing they'll do is check Marcus and Louisa for the Traitor's Gene.</string>
  <string id="16418">So, I'm hog-tied. All I can do is wait for the call and hope those people have a whit of mercy.</string>
  <string id="16419">I'm so sorry, Jacob.</string>
  <string id="16421">Do you have any news about your family?</string>
  <string id="16422">I can't and won't discuss that with you...</string>
  <string id="16423">PERSUADE (-500 reputation points)</string>
  <string id="16424">I feel guilty, Jacob. I didn't know it would turn out like this. I just wanted to help.</string>
  <string id="16425">I don't blame you. I didn't have much of a choice, either. It was either that so-called "shelter" or a labor camp.</string>
  <string id="16426">I don't know which one would be worse. And I... I have to do horrible things to keep my wife and son alive.</string>
  <string id="16427">I have to make drugs for those bastards, which they're going to distribute around the country.</string>
  <string id="16428">That's not why I learned chemistry! But I can't stop! If I do, Louisa and Marcus will die.</string>
  <string id="16429">But that's how things turned out, Hector! So I'm asking you to do one thing - stay out of my way...</string>
  <string id="16430">I'm terribly sorry, Jacob...</string>
  <string id="16431">Go to hell, Hector! And stay out of my way... If you interfere again, Louisa and Marcus could die!</string>
  <string id="16432">That's your right, Jacob.</string>
  <string id="16434">You're back, Jacob!</string>
  <string id="16435">Hector! How did my wife and son come to be arrested?</string>
  <string id="16436">They didn't go to the station for the blood test, so they were arrested for failure to report.</string>
  <string id="16437">My God! They should not have done that!</string>
  <string id="16438">I took our samples myself and secretly checked them in a biolab where a friend works...</string>
  <string id="16439">I found the Traitor's Gene in Louisa and Marcus' blood. Now they'll be checked and sent to the labor camp for traitors!</string>
  <string id="16440">My poor Louisa... My poor Marcus... They won't be able to withstand the rigors of those camps! They're as good as dead...</string>
  <string id="16441">I'm so sorry, Jacob!</string>
  <string id="16442">Go to hell, Ministry rat! You're as heartless a servant as any of those bastards!</string>
  <string id="16443">I bet there's a special spot in Hell for you!</string>
  <string id="19322">Go on…</string>
  <string id="19323">Klaus Schimmer came to me, saying weird things… I thought he was drunk, but now I see, why he wasn't himself.</string>
  <string id="19346">Any news about your family?</string>
  <string id="19348">ASK ABOUT FAMILY</string>
  <string id="19350">How are you, Jacob?</string>
  <string id="19351">I know you had something to do with that tragedy.</string>
  <string id="16080">Hello.</string>
  <string id="16081">RETURN THE GREETING</string>
  <string id="16082">Hi, kiddo...</string>
  <string id="16083">Hi, Uncle Hector. Can I play with your kitty? It's so cute...</string>
  <string id="16084">Do you have candy?</string>
  <string id="16085">I don't have any candy, but you can play with my cat. He's old, so you have to be gentle.</string>
  <string id="16086">He's old? So, he will get the Blissful Sleep treatment soon?</string>
  <string id="16087">...</string>
  <string id="16088">*cough*</string>
  <string id="16089">Perhaps...</string>
  <string id="16090">Then I'll be very gentle!</string>
  <string id="16091">They said on TV that the elderly should be led with kind persistence to that big building.</string>
  <string id="16092">I'll pretend our house is a huge palace!</string>
  <string id="16093">ASK ABOUT THE GAMES SHE PLAYS</string>
  <string id="16094">What are you playing?</string>
  <string id="16095">I'm sad. Mommy and daddy had a fight.</string>
  <string id="16096">Don't worry, they'll make up.</string>
  <string id="16097">Really? Good, 'cause I don't feel like telling my kindergarten teacher about their fight.</string>
  <string id="16098">I don't want to do that at all!</string>
  <string id="16099">You know what I do want to do? Learn more about astronauts! Marcus told me that astronauts who don't have any oxygen in space go "Pop!" That made me laugh...</string>
  <string id="16100">I laugh every time I think about an astronaut going pop in his... his...</string>
  <string id="16101">Spacesuit?</string>
  <string id="16102">Yeah...</string>
  <string id="16103">ASK WHAT SHE WANTS</string>
  <string id="16104">What do you want, Zlata?</string>
  <string id="16105">Can you build us a sandbox - one filled with unlimited toys?</string>
  <string id="16106">And real shovels for digging up treasure? And edible sand?</string>
  <string id="16107">With a real shelter below it - one with the Wise Leader in it?</string>
  <string id="16108">And with your cat not going there...</string>
  <string id="16109">I'm sorry, Zlata, but I'm not planning on building a sandbox.</string>
  <string id="16110">Why not? This building is boring without a sandbox! I have to play with the same things every day!</string>
  <string id="16111">A sandbox would make it so much better!</string>
  <string id="16112">Just think of all the things we could make out of sand! Sand pies, sand cakes, more sand pies...</string>
  <string id="16113">I simply don't have the resources.</string>
  <string id="16114">Marcus and I have decided to start a petition to build a sandbox and then send it to the Ministry.</string>
  <string id="16115">But that would make my work here much harder!</string>
  <string id="16116">What good are you if we can't have a sandbox?</string>
  <string id="16117">I'm sorry you feel that way.</string>
  <string id="16118">Not as sorry as we are about not having a sandbox! Our parents pay taxes, so you have to listen to us!</string>
  <string id="16119">DISCUSS THE MANISHEK'S BOY</string>
  <string id="16120">Who's your friend?</string>
  <string id="16121">Marcus, our neighbor. He's fun and nice, and we were born on the same day!</string>
  <string id="16122">We play games! We played firefighters yesterday!</string>
  <string id="16123">But his dad took the matches away from us. He ruined our game!</string>
  <string id="16124">Your dad did the right thing,. Matches aren't toys!</string>
  <string id="16125">You don't understand... How can I be a firefighter if there's no fire to fight?</string>
  <string id="16126">The whole point of being a firefighter is to make sure there are NO flames anywhere!</string>
  <string id="16127">Then build us a sandbox; nothing will burn in it.</string>
  <string id="16128">END THE CONVERSATION</string>
  <string id="16129">Hello!</string>
  <string id="16130">RETURN THE GREETING</string>
  <string id="16131">Hello, Hector! How are you?</string>
  <string id="16132">I've been better. If you by chance have a bottle of imported wine, I'll feel MUCH better soon!</string>
  <string id="16133">Oh, no, no, no! The Ministry has banned imported wine. We don't break any laws!</string>
  <string id="16135">I'm glad to hear that.</string>
  <string id="16136">ASK ABOUT HER FAMILY</string>
  <string id="16137">Do you live alone?</string>
  <string id="16139">What about your son?</string>
  <string id="16141">No, I'm not talking about that. Does he go to school?</string>
  <string id="16144">ASK ABOUT WORK</string>
  <string id="16149">ASK ABOUT THE BALL</string>
  <string id="16158">TELL HER ABOUT THE TRAGEDY</string>
  <string id="16164">TELL HER ABOUT ZLATA</string>
  <string id="16171">ASK ABOUT JACOB'S REACTION</string>
  <string id="16177">Is there really no way to persuade him? She's his daughter!</string>
  <string id="16196">TALK ABOUT THE SURGERY</string>
  <string id="16200">TALK ABOUT MARCUS</string>
  <string id="16203">What are you going to do now?</string>
  <string id="16205">TALK ABOUT THE ADDRESS</string>
  <string id="16206">Louisa, I know where Marcus was sent. He's in Orphanage 9.</string>
  <string id="16210">END THE CONVERSATION</string>
  <string id="16444">Sorry, that's not my best joke. Believe me, I'm on your side. I hardly drink at all.</string>
  <string id="16445">No, I live with my brilliant husband and wonderful son! My husband is a chemical biologist... At least he used to be when worked at the chemical plant.</string>
  <string id="16446">After the Ministry closed the plant, he started teaching chemistry.</string>
  <string id="16447">Marcus? No, of course not! He's too small to work!</string>
  <string id="16448">No, not yet. He'll be seven soon. We're waiting to find out where he's going to go to school. Marcus is very smart. I think he has the potential to become a Minister!</string>
  <string id="16449">Does anyone else live with you? I'm sorry for prying, but my duty is to know as much as possible about the tenants of the house.</string>
  <string id="16450">You have to maintain order - I understand. No, it's just the three of us. Although I gave birth to twins.</string>
  <string id="16451">Unfortunately, the other child, Marcus' sister, died during childbirth... That's what they told me in the maternity ward.</string>
  <string id="16452">I'm so sorry! The last thing I wanted to do was open old wounds.</string>
  <string id="16453">It happened a long time ago. There's no need to apologize.</string>
  <string id="16454">This question is merely routine: Where do you work?</string>
  <string id="16455">I don't work. I'm on a leave of absence due to my health. I stay home and take care of our son.</string>
  <string id="16456">It's too bad the kindergartens are closed. Marcus gets bored from time to time.</string>
  <string id="16457">Doesn't he play with the neighbor girl?</string>
  <string id="16458">With Zlata? Yes. They get along well, like two peas in a pod. I like her. She's well-bread and always polite.</string>
  <string id="16459">It's a pity Marcus doesn't have a sister. They'd have fun together... I'd have more fun, too.</string>
  <string id="16460">Do you have a ball?</string>
  <string id="16461">Yes, my son always plays with it. Why do you need it?</string>
  <string id="16462">Your neighbor from apartment 1 asked me to get a ball for her daughter. Zlata's birthday is coming up.</string>
  <string id="16463">Maria? It's strange she didn't ask me in person. We've been celebrating our kids' birthdays together for years.</string>
  <string id="16464">I'm sorry, Hector, but I can't take my son's favorite toy from him, even for a reason as good as this. Toys are rare nowadays.</string>
  <string id="16465">That's why we don't allow him to take them outside.</string>
  <string id="16466">I understand. I was hoping you had two balls.</string>
  <string id="16467">I have an idea! Why don't they play together? I'll tell Marcus he and Zlata can play with any of his toys.</string>
  <string id="16468">That sounds great! I think both kids will love that. Thank you, Louisa!</string>
  <string id="16469">Did you hear about what happened to your neighbors? Their daughter was in a terrible accident; she's in critical condition at that hospital. They're looking for a donor.</string>
  <string id="16470">Yes, Maria told me. How horrible! I was already scared to let Marcus go outside and play, but now...</string>
  <string id="16471">Marcus thinks he did something wrong and is being punished, but I can't make myself let him out. It's too dangerous!</string>
  <string id="16472">I feel sorry for our neighbors and wish we could help...</string>
  <string id="16473">You could visit them more often...</string>
  <string id="16474">You're right! I will.</string>
  <string id="16475">Louisa, I have something to tell you, but I don't know how to say it...</string>
  <string id="16476">Well... Zlata is your daughter.</string>
  <string id="16477">WHAT? Hector, are you joking? How is that possible? I was told she died!</string>
  <string id="16478">Are you confused? That's impossible! I don't believe you!</string>
  <string id="16479">I checked twice! She's definitely your daughter. I don't know how that could happen.</string>
  <string id="16480">Someone made a mistake. But that doesn't matter now. What matters is that you can save her!</string>
  <string id="16481">How did she end up with the Schimmers? They went to Valverde for reproductive assistance...</string>
  <string id="16482">I think they made that up so people wouldn't ask if they adopted Zlata.</string>
  <string id="16483">So, Zlata is my daughter... Are you sure?</string>
  <string id="16484">Absolutely!</string>
  <string id="16485">I don't understand how, but I do want to help. Tell me what to do!</string>
  <string id="16486">She's in bad shape; she needs a bone marrow donor.</string>
  <string id="16487">Say no more, Hector. I'll be her donor!</string>
  <string id="16488">Thank you! I'll tell everything to my husband! He'll be thrilled!</string>
  <string id="16489">Louisa, what did Jacob say? Will you be a donor for Zlata?</string>
  <string id="16490">I'm in despair, Hector. At first, Jacob was thrilled about the news. But when he found out that one of us had to be a donor, he became angry!</string>
  <string id="16491">He said he wouldn't allow me to become a donor because the doctors would send Zlata and me to our graves.</string>
  <string id="16492">He spent all night trying to talk me out of it, telling me about the awful conditions in our hospitals. He wants us to help, but he doesn't want us to risk our lives to do so...</string>
  <string id="16493">He loves me and is afraid to lose me! My health is poor, and we do have to think of Marcus!</string>
  <string id="16494">I'm sorry, but I can't do this against his will.</string>
  <string id="16495">I couldn't persuade him. We need to find another way out, even if its illegal.</string>
  <string id="16496">What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="16497">What if my husband had to leave for several days? He used to travel as part of his work for the chemical plant.</string>
  <string id="16498">Professors don't travel on business much...</string>
  <string id="16499">I don't know what to do, Hector. I want to help my daughter, but I can't while Jacob is here.</string>
  <string id="16500">Once he makes up his mind, that's it.</string>
  <string id="16501">LEARN WHAT HAPPENED</string>
  <string id="16502">Louisa, do you want to talk?</string>
  <string id="16503">Hector, Jacob was arrested, and I don't know why! I hope they release him since he teaches at the school for the children of the Ministers.</string>
  <string id="16504">Louisa, that's awful, but it also gives you an opportunity to save Zlata! Go to the hospital and tell them you'll be the donor.</string>
  <string id="16505">Oh! You're right!</string>
  <string id="16506">Tell my husband I'm doing this for the sake of our kids.</string>
  <string id="16507">ASK WHY THEY DIDN'T HAVE THEIR BLOOD TESTED</string>
  <string id="16508">Louisa, why didn't you have your blood tested? You know it's required.</string>
  <string id="16509">Plus, the Ministry could hold me responsible for not making sure you showed up for the procedure.</string>
  <string id="16510">Hector, Marcus and I can't have our &lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#D53838FF&gt;blood tested&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. They'll check for the so-called Traitor's Gene.</string>
  <string id="16511">And Marcus and I both have it.</string>
  <string id="16512">If they test us, they'll arrest us immediately and send us to a reform facility from which no one has returned.</string>
  <string id="16513">Help me!</string>
  <string id="16514">PERSUADE (-500 reputation points)</string>
  <string id="16515">Louisa, the Ministry has already cancelled the directive about eliminating unreliable citizens. Everything would be fine. You have nothing to fear.</string>
  <string id="16516">Are you sure? Why didn't I hear about that? If I had, I wouldn't have hid for so long!</string>
  <string id="16517">I'm absolutely sure! I have access to every government directive.</string>
  <string id="16518">OK... I believe you, Hector.</string>
  <string id="16519">I still don't think it's a good idea.</string>
  <string id="16520">OFFER TO HELP</string>
  <string id="16521">Louisa, I'll try to help you. If you can't allow your blood to be tested, then you need to hide.</string>
  <string id="16522">But where? Do you have a safe place? Or ties to someone who does?</string>
  <string id="16523">No. We need someone who knows how to break the law and won't draw attention to himself.</string>
  <string id="16524">There's someone in this building who's intimately familiar with the black market.</string>
  <string id="16525">Thank you! You're saving our lives! You're a nice person, Hector!</string>
  <string id="16526">You're too kind, Louisa. I don't know how this will turn out.</string>
  <string id="16527">TELL HER ABOUT THE SAFE PLACE</string>
  <string id="16528">I talked to Nathan Kehler. You've probably seen him near the building.</string>
  <string id="16529">Yes. I've bought lollipops for Marcus from him.</string>
  <string id="16530">He gave me a phone number. If you have something to offer, the people on the other end will offer you asylum.</string>
  <string id="16531">But he warned me that those people are very dangerous. I can't make such an important decision for you, so I'm going to give you this phone number and let you decide for yourself: 379-974.</string>
  <string id="16532">Make up your mind.</string>
  <string id="16533">What could be more dangerous than our police?</string>
  <string id="16534">You'd be surprised. I'm begging you to be careful! Those people are no walk in the park.</string>
  <string id="16535">OK...</string>
  <string id="16536">ASK WHAT HAPPENED</string>
  <string id="16537">Did you want something?</string>
  <string id="16538">I called that number and talked to a very nice man. We made a deal! He even didn't tell me the price!</string>
  <string id="16539">That sounds suspicious...</string>
  <string id="16540">Oh, no! When I told him Jacob is a talented chemist, he became very excited!</string>
  <string id="16541">He said it would be his honor to help the wife of the man who made the first cough syrup that both stopped a cough and tasted good!</string>
  <string id="16542">I didn't know that about your husband...</string>
  <string id="16543">He doesn't like to brag about his success. He had his own laboratory before he became a professor.</string>
  <string id="16544">An underhanded colleague took the credit for some of Jacob's work and was promoted to supervisor. He then made work hell for my husband. That was a sad situation. Jacob was forced to quit and start working at the plant. Then the plant closed, too.</string>
  <string id="16545">Now Jacob teaches gifted children, but I'm sure he misses his lab and the freedom of conducting experiments and breaking new ground!</string>
  <string id="16546">I'm packing my things, Hector.</string>
  <string id="16547">I left a note for Jacob. Please tell him everything if he doesn't find it.</string>
  <string id="16548">Thank you for your help!</string>
  <string id="16549">Be careful, Louisa.</string>
  <string id="16550">You're not good at judging people, Hector. But that's what makes you such a nice man!</string>
  <string id="16551">You worry about us. That's touching. Thank you for everything!</string>
  <string id="16552">Hello, Louisa! It seems the surgery was successful!</string>
  <string id="16553">Yes, we did it, thanks to you! Zlata is still in recovery, but she'll be released from the hospital soon.</string>
  <string id="16554">Thanks for everything... I met someone in the hospital. They offered to help me...</string>
  <string id="16555">I... I want to leave... Before Jacob returns...</string>
  <string id="16556">What are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="16557">I don't know why I'm telling you this... Perhaps I'm hoping you'll validate my decision...</string>
  <string id="16558">Hector, when Jacob worked in the laboratory, he checked our blood just in case.</string>
  <string id="16559">And he found the Traitor's Gene in my blood and the blood of our son... That means Zlata has it, too.</string>
  <string id="16560">It's a miracle nobody checked her blood after the accident. As soon as our blood is checked...</string>
  <string id="16561">...my kids and I will be sent to a labor camp.</string>
  <string id="16562">I want to take both kids as far away from here as I can.</string>
  <string id="16563">But Zlata is not your daughter officially!</string>
  <string id="16564">Do you think I don't know that? I'm aware that the state will consider me to be a criminal!</string>
  <string id="16565">But I must rescue them. They're mine...</string>
  <string id="16566">What about your husband?</string>
  <string id="16567">He refused to help Zlata when she needed us.</string>
  <string id="16568">My gut says he won't like this idea, either, but I don't have the energy or the desire to persuade him otherwise.</string>
  <string id="16569">Tell Jacob not to look for us.</string>
  <string id="16570">Louisa, what happened? Why were you deprived of custody of Marcus?</string>
  <string id="16571">He said Marcus ran away from home. But he rushed to rescue his sister... He's my little hero! How did he know? I didn't say a word to him.</string>
  <string id="16572">Let's go! I need information! Bring it to me! I must know where he is! I won't abandon my son!</string>
  <string id="16573">I beg you, Hector! I know you can help.</string>
  <string id="16574">I'll see what I can do.</string>
  <string id="16575">Thank you, Hector! You've been a tremendous help! My gratitude knows no bounds.</string>
  <string id="16576">What's next, Louisa?</string>
  <string id="16577">I become a criminal who kidnaps her own child and runs.</string>
  <string id="16578">My God! What about your husband?</string>
  <string id="19057">ASK WHAT SHE WANTS</string>
  <string id="19058">I found bed bugs. I bet Marcus brought them in one of his bags, even though he won't admit to it.</string>
  <string id="19059">Can you exterminate them?</string>
  <string id="19060">SELL THE CHEMICAL (-250 reputation points)</string>
  <string id="19061">Why poison the whole block? I have a great spray for only $500.</string>
  <string id="19062">Kids are so expensive nowadays…. There you go.</string>
  <string id="19063">Oh, no, I'm completely broke at the moment…</string>
  <string id="19064">CALM DOWN</string>
  <string id="19065">Are you sure? I have no clue where they came from!</string>
  <string id="19066">I'm sure.</string>
  <string id="19067">Don't worry, I'll take care of this as soon as I can.</string>
  <string id="19692">TALK ABOUT THE BEDBUGS</string>
  <string id="16211">Hello.</string>
  <string id="16212">RETURN THE GREETING</string>
  <string id="16213">Hi, Marcus. How are you?</string>
  <string id="16214">Hi, Hector. I'm fine.</string>
  <string id="16215">Good boy. Seen anything suspicious lately?</string>
  <string id="16216">Like what?</string>
  <string id="16217">Like enemy spies? Or criminals? Or aliens?</string>
  <string id="16218">Aliens? That's science fiction, and science fiction is banned!</string>
  <string id="16219">You're a smart boy. Stay aware, son!</string>
  <string id="16220">I'm more aware than anyone!</string>
  <string id="16221">ASK WHAT HE WANTS</string>
  <string id="16222">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="16223">I have a great idea! Let's build a sandbox! They're cool, and everyone could play in it whenever they want!</string>
  <string id="16224">I could play in a sandbox forever! They're the best thing ever!</string>
  <string id="16225">Unfortunately, Marcus, it would be nearly impossible to build a sandbox. All of the sand we mine is used to build new apartment buildings. I doubt I could get any.</string>
  <string id="16226">But everyone needs a sandbox! Kids, grown-ups - everyone! Even your cat would love it!</string>
  <string id="16227">DISCUSS THE NEIGHBOR GIRL</string>
  <string id="16228">Do you know Zlata in apartment 1?</string>
  <string id="16229">Yeah! She's awesome! We played ball the other day. She had a good time! We're a lot alike. We even like the same things!</string>
  <string id="16230">We both like the sandbox idea! Could you somehow make it happen?</string>
  <string id="16231">I'm sorry, but no.</string>
  <string id="16232">DISCUSS FIREWORKS</string>
  <string id="16233">Did you like the fireworks?</string>
  <string id="16234">Yeah! Too bad the roof didn't catch fire. The firefighters would have come!</string>
  <string id="16235">TELL HIM ZLATA IS HIS SISTER</string>
  <string id="16236">I have something sad to tell you, Marcus. Zlata is in the hospital; she's in bad shape.</string>
  <string id="16237">No! We just played together! It can't be true!</string>
  <string id="16238">I understand how horrible that is. But there's more. Can you keep a secret?</string>
  <string id="16239">You bet! Dad once drank all the cognac mom was saving for the holidays and then told me to keep it a secret.</string>
  <string id="16240">I didn't say a peep!</string>
  <string id="16241">Do you realize you just told me?</string>
  <string id="16242">Anyway...</string>
  <string id="16243">Well... Don't tell anyone it was me who told you, OK?</string>
  <string id="16244">I won't tell - I promise! Pinky swear!</string>
  <string id="16245">Zlata is your sister. You were born on the same day, but she was taken from your mom.</string>
  <string id="16246">What? She's my sister? Yahoo!!! I have a sister!</string>
  <string id="16247">Unfortunately, she's very sick and needs a donor. Do you know what a donor is?</string>
  <string id="16248">Yes. It's when one TV gets a lamp from another TV. You need to take something out of me and give it to her, right?</string>
  <string id="16249">I'll do it! I'll save Zlata!</string>
  <string id="16250">You're a brave boy, Marcus. Zlata is in Hospital 3, on Burnt Youth Street. You can visit her and tell the doctors you're her brother.</string>
  <string id="16251">They'll surely let you in. But don't tell anyone, OK?</string>
  <string id="16252">OK! Thanks! I'm going to save my sister!</string>
  <string id="16253">END THE CONVERSATION</string>
  <string id="16579">ASK WHAT HAPPENED</string>
  <string id="16580">Marcus, what happened?</string>
  <string id="16581">Uncle Hector, I'm hungry! Do you have any food?</string>
  <string id="16582">Let's see.</string>
  <string id="16583">GIVE MARCUS A SANDWICH</string>
  <string id="16584">Here's a sandwich.</string>
  <string id="16585">Thank you, Uncle Hector! I love sandwiches!</string>
  <string id="16586">What is it, Marcus?</string>
  <string id="16587">I'm thirsty.</string>
  <string id="16588">What would you like? Some water?</string>
  <string id="16589">Nope! I'd rather have lemonade!</string>
  <string id="16590">Okay, I'll see what I can do.</string>
  <string id="16591">GIVE MARCUS LEMONADE</string>
  <string id="16592">Here's some lemonade, Marcus. It wasn't easy to come by!</string>
  <string id="16593">Thank you!</string>
  <string id="16272">What are you doing here?</string>
  <string id="16273">I'm checking on you.</string>
  <string id="16274">Dad says when people come uninvited, they're either policemen or thieves.</string>
  <string id="16275">You don't look like a policeman, Uncle Hector.</string>
  <string id="16276">But I'm no thief, either, sweetie. I'm the supervisor of this building.</string>
  <string id="16277">Don't tell mom this place was a mess! I'll pick it up! We're fine.</string>
  <string id="16278">Deal.</string>
  <string id="16279">Let's play war!</string>
  <string id="16280">Um, I'm not here to play; I need to see your parents. Are they home?</string>
  <string id="16281">No, I'm here alone, playing war! It would be more fun if you played with me!</string>
  <string id="16282">I have to go.</string>
  <string id="16283">Too bad! I just built a trench! And this iron is my tank!</string>
  <string id="16739">SAY HELLO</string>
  <string id="16740">Good afternoon, Mark.</string>
  <string id="16741">What's good about it?</string>
  <string id="16742">It could be better. My rheumatism has flared up.</string>
  <string id="16743">That's because you live in the basement. Dampness and cold are a curse at your age.</string>
  <string id="16744">My age? I'm younger than you!</string>
  <string id="16745">Really? According to my documents, I'm 20 years younger than you!</string>
  <string id="16746">But how is that possible? You...</string>
  <string id="16747">Look much older... Is that what you want to say? As a honorary archives worker, I can say it doesn't matter how young or old a person looks.</string>
  <string id="16748">What matters is what's written on the documents. And I DO know how to work them. Hehehe...</string>
  <string id="16749">ASK ABOUT THE LATEST NEWS</string>
  <string id="16750">What's going on in this great country of ours?</string>
  <string id="16751">People say there's no order in the Ministry of Order... Hahaha! Hey... I'm joking.</string>
  <string id="16752">What do you want to hear, Hector? That everything is stable, and our country is racing toward a better tomorrow?</string>
  <string id="16753">Don't you read the newspapers?</string>
  <string id="16754">I'm in "no newspapers" mode.</string>
  <string id="16755">I understand. I make cigarettes out of them.</string>
  <string id="16756">Be careful, Mark. If you do anything with a newspaper besides read it, leave our leader's photos untouched.</string>
  <string id="16757">Otherwise, you'll be given the full measure of justice for disrespecting the state and the rule of law!</string>
  <string id="16758">You're a smart aleck, huh?</string>
  <string id="16759">TALK ABOUT THE WEATHER</string>
  <string id="16760">The weather hasn't been good this summer...</string>
  <string id="16761">Who cares about the weather, Hector?</string>
  <string id="16762">It's the same year-round. You should be used to it by now...</string>
  <string id="16763">TALK ABOUT THE WAR</string>
  <string id="16764">Have you heard any news from the battlefield?</string>
  <string id="16765">Of course!</string>
  <string id="16766">Our troops strike, the enemies drop back, and vice versa.</string>
  <string id="16767">Do you think the war will ever end?</string>
  <string id="16768">That's none of our business... Our job is to sit in the archives and sort out files.</string>
  <string id="16769">I don't care what we have to issue: reports about how great the government is doing or death certificates - it's all the same to me.</string>
  <string id="16770">We'd better just sit still and be happy that they don't haul us off because of our age.</string>
  <string id="16771">ASK ABOUT THE INFORMATION</string>
  <string id="16772">Could you do me a favor, Mark, and find one particular document in the archives? It's very important.</string>
  <string id="16773">Important? How could anything of importance be in the archives?</string>
  <string id="16774">I need to know who Zlata Schimmer's real parents are. She's at the hospital now and needs a donor, but Klaus doesn't know anything about her natural parents.</string>
  <string id="16775">She's not their biological daughter? *cough* *cough*</string>
  <string id="16776">First, they bring kids here from the orphanages, and then the entire building suffers from the noise and the crying.</string>
  <string id="16777">Mark, this is about a child's life.</string>
  <string id="16778">Yeah, I get it. But that's no easy task. Taking documents out of the archives is strictly prohibited. I won't do it for free, even for the sake of a child.</string>
  <string id="16779">What do you want? Money?</string>
  <string id="16780">Ha! Why would an old man like me need money? Besides, what can anyone buy in our country? Mended socks?</string>
  <string id="16781">Listen... My wife wants a job at Cafeteria No. 389, but she doesn't have a health permit. According to the waiting list, she'll get one in two years.</string>
  <string id="16782">Bring me the permit, and I'll bring you the documents you need.</string>
  <string id="16783">Where could I find one? I don't know any cooks!</string>
  <string id="16784">Aren't you the one who decides who moves into your building?</string>
  <string id="16785">OK, Mark. I'll see what I can do.</string>
  <string id="16786">ASK ABOUT THE STATE STANDARD FORM</string>
  <string id="16787">Can I ask you about one thing, Mark? Can you bring me a state standard form? I need one for a good deed!</string>
  <string id="16788">What kind of good deed? People don't ask for that form without a good reason. I bet someone is in a mess and wants to get off the hook!</string>
  <string id="16789">Is it that so-called artist from the neighboring apartment?</string>
  <string id="16790">Mark, I really need your help! That person will be executed for wasting the government's money...</string>
  <string id="16791">Ha! I was right! He shouldn't have wasted money then! He's responsible for his own actions!</string>
  <string id="16792">In the old days, people cut the hands off of thieves and then kicked the bastards out in the freezing cold.</string>
  <string id="16793">Why were they so cruel?</string>
  <string id="16794">So the thief would get a cold and be unable to blow his nose. How could he without his hands? It was torture! A thief would have the sniffles all the time!</string>
  <string id="16795">Everyone knew who the thieves were - the ones with the sniffles!</string>
  <string id="16796">That's silly. Wouldn't having no hands get the message across?</string>
  <string id="16797">You're boring, Hector! I can't even enjoy telling you a tall tale!</string>
  <string id="16798">OK! I've saw an old state standard form in the archive. Nobody will miss it.</string>
  <string id="16799">Bring me a bottle of whiskey, and it's yours.</string>
  <string id="16800">GIVE HIM THE BOTTLE OF WHISKEY</string>
  <string id="16801">Mark, I have what you asked for.</string>
  <string id="16802">Nice choice, Hector. The form is yours. Let me know if you need anything else.</string>
  <string id="16803">GIVE HIM THE HEALTH PERMIT</string>
  <string id="16804">Mark, I have what you asked for. It took a bit of work, but I got it.</string>
  <string id="16805">That's great news! Now Rosa can get a job in the cafeteria. And I'll be able to spend some time without her buzzing in my ear.</string>
  <string id="16806">I've always said a woman is like a chainsaw: she needs to work or she'll get dull - or cut off her husband's head!</string>
  <string id="16807">What do you want in return for the health permit?</string>
  <string id="16809">OK, here it is... Don't tell anyone where you got it!</string>
  <string id="16810">I'll deny everything.</string>
  <string id="16811">ASK WHAT HE NEEDS</string>
  <string id="16812">Medina! That's awful! I found bedbugs in my bed today! Where did those little pests come from?</string>
  <string id="16813">Solve this problem now or I'll complain about you to the Ministry!</string>
  <string id="16814">Bedbugs? Where did they come from?</string>
  <string id="16815">I have no idea! And I don't have the time to find out! We're too busy scratching ourselves!</string>
  <string id="16816">If you don't deal with this as soon as possible, Hector, I'll drag my mattress to the basement of this building!</string>
  <string id="16817">I'll also bring a jar full of cockroaches from the archives and release them into your basement apartment!</string>
  <string id="16818">Calm down, Mark. I'll find a way to help you!</string>
  <string id="16819">TALK ABOUT THE BEDBUGS</string>
  <string id="16820">Did you take care of the bedbugs?</string>
  <string id="16821">YES</string>
  <string id="16822">There will soon be no trace of the bugs. The sanitation service will be here soon.</string>
  <string id="16823">Good! They smell like cognac, which we don't have.</string>
  <string id="16824">And we're tired of itching all of the time!</string>
  <string id="16825">NO</string>
  <string id="16826">I'll take care of it.</string>
  <string id="16827">I'm waiting! I've already written the complaint, and it will take all of three minutes to send it.</string>
  <string id="16828">TALK ABOUT DONATING BLOOD</string>
  <string id="16829">Mark, every one must donate blood for the troops at the front line.</string>
  <string id="16830">Will you go?</string>
  <string id="16831">I've already donated so much blood to our great and glorious state that I can't spare another drop!</string>
  <string id="16832">Of course.</string>
  <string id="16833">TALK ABOUT EUTHANASIA</string>
  <string id="16834">Have you heard about the Blissful Sleep procedure?</string>
  <string id="16835">I have!</string>
  <string id="16836">What do you think about it?</string>
  <string id="16837">Rosa and I have a lot of time left before we have to go. Moreover, the law could be changed at any moment. Or - who knows? - our documents might get lost in the archives...</string>
  <string id="16838">My wife and I are diligent citizens and are preparing for it just in case. We've already written our wills.</string>
  <string id="16839">By the way, they say the Ministry of Beforehand Applications will be open soon. One can earn extra food cards for going early.</string>
  <string id="16840">Do they think people would go to the Euthanasia Center EARLY in exchange for food?</string>
  <string id="16841">I've seen people do all kinds of things for food.</string>
  <string id="16842">TALK ABOUT ZLATA GETTING HIT BY A CAR</string>
  <string id="16843">Did you hear about Zlata Schimmer, Mark? She was hit by a car!</string>
  <string id="16844">Kids are always getting in trouble. They say an adult is a kid who accidentally survived.</string>
  <string id="16845">I'm glad we have only one child. And I'm glad he's all grown up.</string>
  <string id="16846">TALK ABOUT ROSE RANEK'S HEALTH</string>
  <string id="16847">How's your wife?</string>
  <string id="16848">It seems she's giving up. She recently said something like, "I'm dead! I'm burning from the inside!"</string>
  <string id="16849">That's a troubling sign...</string>
  <string id="16850">Yes. She used to say that when she was young. It seems she's gone mad.</string>
  <string id="16851">TALK ABOUT MANISHEK</string>
  <string id="16852">Do you know what's going on with our neighbor, Jacob?</string>
  <string id="16853">I have no idea! He's as mad as a hornet! Perhaps it's because of his family.</string>
  <string id="16854">We need to move him out! If he can't be his own man, he should be sent to the front lines.</string>
  <string id="16855">Once there, he'll quickly learn his place.</string>
  <string id="16856">END THE CONVERSATION</string>
  <string id="16924">Is your memory playing tricks on you, Mark? We had an agreement about the personal records of the Schimmer's child.</string>
  <string id="19068">SELL THE CHEMICAL (-500 reputation points)</string>
  <string id="19069">Let's resort to local measures. I have that amazing spray for only $500!</string>
  <string id="19070">Ah, what the heck. Give it here. At least, I'll stop itching!</string>
  <string id="19071">Local, huh? How about I use my crutch locally? On your ribs, for example?</string>
  <string id="19072">Get to work, lazy ass!</string>
  <string id="16857">Good afternoon!</string>
  <string id="16858">RETURN THE GREETING</string>
  <string id="16860">How are you, Rosa?</string>
  <string id="16861">My sciatica is killing me! It's so cold in our apartment!</string>
  <string id="16862">Dear Hector, can you help with the heating somehow?</string>
  <string id="16863">I'll do what I can. The lack of coal in our country makes it hard to keep a building warm.</string>
  <string id="16864">We live near the mines, but receive coal only on a holiday!</string>
  <string id="16865">Everything they mine is sent to the plants and the front lines.</string>
  <string id="16866">I know, dear, but that doesn't warm me up. Sometimes, I'm tempted to grab all those old newspapers...</string>
  <string id="16867">...the one with the photos of our Wise Leader. Mark keeps them but never uses them to make cigarettes. Our closet is full of pictures of him!</string>
  <string id="16868">I want to take all those photos and make a big fire in the furnace just to be warm for a day.</string>
  <string id="16869">You can't do that, Rosa! And don't tell anyone else what you just told me!</string>
  <string id="16870">If someone turns you in, you'll be charged with disrespecting the patriotism of the workers.</string>
  <string id="16871">What patriotism?</string>
  <string id="16872">When it's time to clean the entrance hall, I see neither workers nor patriotism... When it's time to be offended, there they are!</string>
  <string id="16873">TALK ABOUT THE COLD</string>
  <string id="16874">It's been getting colder and colder. How do you feel, Rosa?</string>
  <string id="16875">No better than I should be at my age. The pain in my back never goes away.</string>
  <string id="16876">Mark says I need a warming balm, but where could I get one? We haven't seen mustard or pepper for 10 years.</string>
  <string id="16877">GIVE HER THE BALM</string>
  <string id="16878">If you want, I can give you an amazing warming balm, Rosa! It will heat you up in an instant!</string>
  <string id="16879">Thank you, my dear! What is it? It says...</string>
  <string id="16880">The warming balm, Merry Dracaris, will breath new life into your body...</string>
  <string id="16881">I haven't seen this at the drug stores. Thank you! Take this in exchange for your help!</string>
  <string id="16882">OFFER YOUR SYMPATHY</string>
  <string id="16883">I'm sorry. I wish I could help, but I don't have anything. My apartment is freezing, too.</string>
  <string id="16884">ASK WHAT SHE NEEDS</string>
  <string id="16885">Do you want something?</string>
  <string id="16886">The balm you gave me - it burned me!</string>
  <string id="16887">What was it, Hector? My chest still feels like it's on fire!</string>
  <string id="16888">You're exaggerating, Rosa! That couldn't be true!</string>
  <string id="16889">So my clothes burned on their own? You owe me a new cardigan, Hector!</string>
  <string id="16890">I'm afraid I don't have one. I meant well, Rosa.</string>
  <string id="16891">Oh, darling, sometimes it's better to leave everything as it is.</string>
  <string id="16892">Although I DO feel much warmer than before.</string>
  <string id="16893">Isn't that good?</string>
  <string id="16894">I guess, but sometimes, I feel so hot, I want to tear off my clothes!</string>
  <string id="16895">But it's indecent to walk around naked, especially at my age! I'm no strapping barbarian riding a horse!</string>
  <string id="16896">I'm sorry, Rosa. I have to go... Have a good day...</string>
  <string id="16897">TALK ABOUT EUTHANASIA</string>
  <string id="16898">Have you heard about the Blissful Sleep procedure?</string>
  <string id="16899">Don't remind me about it. Perhaps they'll rescind it...</string>
  <string id="16900">I doubt it.</string>
  <string id="16901">If they want to save money, they could cancel everyone's pensions! Those who have kids would survive.</string>
  <string id="16902">The kids would support their parents.</string>
  <string id="16903">I've heard that's how they create jobs and drive the economy...</string>
  <string id="16904">I don't understand the economy... I'm too old for all of that trickery anyway. Mark and I have seen a lot...</string>
  <string id="16905">Remember my words - if a person receives nothing early in life, he or she won't want to work later on.</string>
  <string id="16906">Hector! We have bedbugs in our apartment! How did that happen?</string>
  <string id="16907">This has never happened before!</string>
  <string id="16908">That's terrible!</string>
  <string id="16909">It's a nightmare, Hector! Those little bloodsuckers are making us miserable!</string>
  <string id="16910">I'll try to solve the problem as soon as possible!</string>
  <string id="16911">Please do! Mark is furious. He wrote a letter of complaint about you and is threatening to send it!</string>
  <string id="16912">TALK ABOUT ZLATA GETTING HIT BY A CAR</string>
  <string id="16913">Did you hear about Zlata Schimmer, Rosa? She was hit by a car!</string>
  <string id="16914">That's too bad! Poor girl! I can't imagine how her parents feel...</string>
  <string id="16915">TALK ABOUT MANISHEK</string>
  <string id="16916">Do you know what's going on with our neighbor, Jacob?</string>
  <string id="16917">I do. He's in mourning...</string>
  <string id="16918">He had a beautiful wife and son... They lived in harmony, he had a good job... And then everything was gone in a blink of an eye!</string>
  <string id="16919">He lost everything! It's no wonder he's angry with the world. It's sad; they were nice people...</string>
  <string id="16920">END THE CONVERSATION</string>
  <string id="16945">Fancy meeting you here...</string>
  <string id="16946">SAY HELLO</string>
  <string id="16947">Hello, George. How's your job?</string>
  <string id="16948">How could you call this a job? I'm wasting my life on this drivel!</string>
  <string id="16949">Are you painting propaganda again?</string>
  <string id="16950">Yes... It's not exactly what I dreamed I'd be doing as I studied the works of the great artists - and as I developed and nurtured my gift!</string>
  <string id="16951">I'm beginning to doubt I even have a gift... I used to be sure I could create something brilliant...</string>
  <string id="16952">And now... Do I still have it in me? Only Melpomene knows!</string>
  <string id="16953">I'm sure this job is temporary. You'll have a chance to show the world your talent someday, George.</string>
  <string id="16954">While I, George de Latour, agonize in anticipation of that favorable time, any narrow-minded gendarme can drag me through the mud with a kick of a jackboot.</string>
  <string id="16955">The chastity of the ardent soul is at risk of dying on the vine of unscrupulous obscenity!</string>
  <string id="16956">I'm afraid I no longer understand what we're talking about...</string>
  <string id="16957">Like the Fates weave the web of human history, two people weave the thread of their conversation, not knowing where it will go...</string>
  <string id="16958">TALK ABOUT CREATIVITY</string>
  <string id="16959">How's your creative process coming along?</string>
  <string id="16960">I'm a freelance artist! My tiffany-like nature is locked in a cage of primitive desires.</string>
  <string id="16961">To be able to create something, I need to eat, but to eat, I need money. My art, my legacy - my very existence - hangs on the threads of these primordial needs.</string>
  <string id="16962">What is a man when his only concern is eating and sleeping? An animal, and nothing more!</string>
  <string id="16963">You're a starving artist! That's wonderful!</string>
  <string id="16964">What do you know about these things Hector? If only I could paint on an empty stomach!</string>
  <string id="16965">Some artists become quite famous after they die. But I don't think you're time is up, George.</string>
  <string id="16966">Hector, if I don't comply with the government's orders, I will either starve to death or be imprisoned for having dissenting views.</string>
  <string id="16967">The boat of creativity has crashed against the shores of the daily grind, and my growling stomach mutes my thoughts about celestial matters! How trivial!</string>
  <string id="16968">How incredibly sad...</string>
  <string id="16969">Please forgive my lofty speech, my friend. I did not want to upset you.</string>
  <string id="16970">Perhaps I should go back to spoiling this paper with vulgar slogans.</string>
  <string id="16971">TALK ABOUT THE STATUE</string>
  <string id="16972">I saw a statue in your apartment...</string>
  <string id="16973">Congratulate me, Hector! I've received an order to make a statue of our Wise Leader. This is a big deal!</string>
  <string id="16974">If I deliver it on time, I'll be sitting pretty for a while. I won't have to worry about money, food - nothing!</string>
  <string id="16975">I'll finally be able to devote myself to my art - to creating graceful, delicate shapes and marble curves!</string>
  <string id="16976">Isn't marble given out only by order of the Ministry for creating busts and statues of our Wise Leader?</string>
  <string id="16977">Damn! I forgot about that... There are so many busts of the Leader out there. They all look alike, too, like carbon copies of each other.</string>
  <string id="16978">My freedom is a shadow, and I've long been a dumb vassal of his arrogant will...</string>
  <string id="16979">I haven't heard about any quotas on alabaster...</string>
  <string id="16980">Alabaster? Hector! You're a genius! Not as much of a genius as me, but still, that's a delightful idea!</string>
  <string id="16981">I'll use alabaster! The plebs will finally understand what true art is!</string>
  <string id="16982">TALK ABOUT A WOMAN'S STATUE</string>
  <string id="16983">George, what are you making?</string>
  <string id="16984">I already told you, Hector, I received an order to make a statue of our Wise Leader!</string>
  <string id="16985">The Ministry is going to pay me enough to live carefree for a few years.</string>
  <string id="16986">George, are you saying our Wise Leader is a woman?</string>
  <string id="16987">So, you know everything? Oh my God!</string>
  <string id="16988">Please, Hector, help me!</string>
  <string id="16989">I'm dying of my love for the unforgettable Jeanne Oehrn...</string>
  <string id="16990">If I don't die, then I'll be executed by a firing squad. Darts of love are less painful than cold, lead bullets, you know...</string>
  <string id="16991">What do you want from me?</string>
  <string id="16992">I fell head over heels for passion! Blindly and mindlessly love rushes, not knowing where it's heading...</string>
  <string id="16993">I'm just a man with a warm heart and an open soul...</string>
  <string id="16994">Which everyone is willing to trample with his muddy boots... George, I understand what you're saying, but, please, stay on point.</string>
  <string id="16995">For me, every moment of life counts. This is not a figure of speech but my horrible reality!</string>
  <string id="16996">I had nearly finished the statue of our leader when I was overcome with temptation...</string>
  <string id="16997">...and I sculptured the face of my muse, my beautiful Jeanne, on the back of it. The stronger the passion, the sadder its end.</string>
  <string id="16998">If the selection committee finds it, they'll shoot me!</string>
  <string id="16999">The paper that proves conformity to state standards is more important to these monsters than human life!</string>
  <string id="17000">Even statues are made according to state standards, Hector... Talk about taking a dagger to the heart of creativity...</string>
  <string id="17001">TALK ABOUT THE STATE STANDARDS FOR THE STATUE</string>
  <string id="17002">Do you have to follow state standards while making the statue?</string>
  <string id="17003">Yes. I have to fill in a state standards form detailing my plans for the piece and then show it to the hollow-hearted selection committee.</string>
  <string id="17004">Anything printed on paper and bearing a stamp is truth to them.</string>
  <string id="17005">Even if I write that the leader should have a pinecone nose and woodpecker hands, they'll accept it!</string>
  <string id="17006">Where can I find this form? I'm not a magician; I can't pull a rabbit out of a hat.</string>
  <string id="17007">Ask the neighbors, call the authorities, do whatever you can! I beg you, please, help me!</string>
  <string id="17008">I can't promise anything, but I'll try.</string>
  <string id="17009">I thank you from the bottom of my heart!</string>
  <string id="17010">I brought you a piece of stamped paper. Write whatever you want on it and the committee will accept your statue.</string>
  <string id="17011">Hector, you're my savior! I will paint my next picture in your honor!</string>
  <string id="17012">You said you need a state standards form...</string>
  <string id="17013">Please hurry, Hector! My clock is ticking, and each second makes the movement of the timing mechanism louder and the end more inevitable!</string>
  <string id="17014">ASK ABOUT THE STATUE</string>
  <string id="17015">Hector! What a delight it is to see you! I owe you so much because of your help with the marble nonsense!</string>
  <string id="17016">I'm very much obliged to you, which is why...</string>
  <string id="17017">This is my humble gift to you – to thank you for your help!</string>
  <string id="17018">You're welcome! It was my pleasure...</string>
  <string id="17019">TALK ABOUT THE BROKEN STATUE</string>
  <string id="17020">George, what happened here?</string>
  <string id="17021">Jeanne has turned into a wild tigress! She was divinely beautiful in her rage, like Alecto or Tisiphone...</string>
  <string id="17022">But she destroyed the statue, and now my life is over... She screamed something about love for one's country, for one's work... I don't know what's going on, Hector.</string>
  <string id="17023">The potion you mentioned should have set her heart on fire, flaming with love for me, not the state!</string>
  <string id="17024">I didn't know what would happen either, George.</string>
  <string id="17025">Ah, well... This must be my fate. Love runs away from those who chase her, and throws herself on the necks of those who run away.</string>
  <string id="17026">Now Jeanne, the light of my eyes, my muse, will leave me and this cheerless grey abode...</string>
  <string id="17027">That's why I'm drinking, even though I see no truth in wine... Yet I'd encounter my end with a contemptuous smile and a glass in my hand!</string>
  <string id="17028">TALK ABOUT JEANNE</string>
  <string id="17029">What happened between you two?</string>
  <string id="17030">She said I'm a worthless, miserable citizen of this great nation, and carried on about her love for her country, and for her work... I didn't understand any of it, Hector.</string>
  <string id="17031">She left while saying she won't be back.</string>
  <string id="17032">I'm very sorry, George.</string>
  <string id="17033">I have no reason to stay here anymore. I have money but no muse, and therefore no inspiration. Love fades as we part...</string>
  <string id="17034">I think I'll have to go away soon, Hector. I don't care where, I just need to get away from the place where everything reminds me of her!</string>
  <string id="17035">How often we regret what we once wished for...</string>
  <string id="17036">TALK ABOUT THE MISTRESS</string>
  <string id="17037">Who's that woman who's visiting you?</string>
  <string id="17038">You saw her? Of course you did! Who wouldn't notice a goddess like her?</string>
  <string id="17039">She's my beautiful model, Jeanne Oehrn! This enchantress has &lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#D53838FF&gt;stolen my heart&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, Hector.</string>
  <string id="17040">All of my thoughts are focused on her... Although she hasn't warmed up to me yet, each obstacle makes my love that much stronger!</string>
  <string id="17041">FIND OUT WHAT HE WANTS</string>
  <string id="17042">What is it, George?</string>
  <string id="17043">Like a wild beast, I can't tame my troubled thoughts about the miserable fortune we all face...</string>
  <string id="17044">Could you just tell me about your problem in plain English?</string>
  <string id="17045">Do you know what unrequited love is, Hector?</string>
  <string id="17046">I know what it's like to lose a beloved wife, George. I believe that's more than enough to allow me to understand you.</string>
  <string id="17047">Jeanne doesn't love me, and I want - more than anything else in the world - her to love me as passionately as I do her!</string>
  <string id="17048">I'll stop at nothing to achieve my goal. I'm desperate, to the point of being willing to try a love potion!</string>
  <string id="17049">If such a potion worked, would it not be a deceit? Would your conscience not smite you?</string>
  <string id="17050">Find a way to make Jeanne fall in love with me, Hector! I'll give up everything for her love: my honor, my soul - even my conscience!</string>
  <string id="17051">I don't think I can help you. But you never know... I'll ask around.</string>
  <string id="17052">Thank you!</string>
  <string id="17053">ASK FOR AN IMAGE OF A NUDE GIRL</string>
  <string id="17054">George, I have an unusual request. You're an artist, and, well...</string>
  <string id="17055">Do you by change have a picture of a naked girl?</string>
  <string id="17056">Hector! What do you need it at your age? Do you believe, as a poet put it, that "Everything in love is true, but lust always lies?"</string>
  <string id="17057">George, I swear, it's not for me.</string>
  <string id="17058">Then why do you need it? Do you have an order from the Ministry?</string>
  <string id="17059">CONVINCE (-300 points of authority)</string>
  <string id="17060">Stop it, George. A young person simply wants to decorate his photo album...</string>
  <string id="17061">Well, the young ones do tend to be hasty and chase naked naiads...</string>
  <string id="17062">I have plenty of nudes! Take whichever one you want, Hector.</string>
  <string id="17063">Stop hindering my work, Hector. I have nothing to do with such things!</string>
  <string id="17064">END THE CONVERSATION</string>
  <string id="17065">COLOR THE STUFFED BIRD</string>
  <string id="17066">Hi George, I need your help.</string>
  <string id="17067">Anything you want, my friend. I need a break from spoiling paper with pointless, soulless slogans...</string>
  <string id="17068">Can you paint this stuffed bird so that it resembles a parrot?</string>
  <string id="17069">What frivolous work! This is great, Hector! This is exactly what I need to blow away the cobwebs!</string>
  <string id="17070">I can turn any piece of trash into a work of art.</string>
  <string id="17071">Well, well...</string>
  <string id="17072">One more stroke...</string>
  <string id="17073">...</string>
  <string id="17074">A little light in the eyes...</string>
  <string id="17075">A couple more strokes here and...done! Here's your bird of happiness! I've never seen a live parrot, but I hope they look like this.</string>
  <string id="17076">Thank you, George! You've been a big help. Excellent work!</string>
  <string id="17077">Do you want something?</string>
  <string id="17078">Bed bugs have infested my apartment! This is unacceptable! Instead of creating art I'm spending my time scratching myself!</string>
  <string id="17079">With the exception of this giving my brush strokes a unique, unrestrained flair, it's unbearable!</string>
  <string id="17080">As if the government sucking the life blood out of me every day wasn't enough, I now have to contend with these tiny parasites as well!</string>
  <string id="17081">Do something, Hector, please!</string>
  <string id="17082">I'm working on it.</string>
  <string id="17083">TALK ABOUT THE BEDBUGS</string>
  <string id="17084">Have you taken any steps toward removing those small bloodsuckers from my life?</string>
  <string id="17085">YES</string>
  <string id="17086">Soon, those buggers will be over and done with.</string>
  <string id="17087">Thank God. My creative process is drained of blood - no pun intended.</string>
  <string id="17088">NO</string>
  <string id="17089">No, but I'll resolve this issue soon.</string>
  <string id="17090">You'd better hurry, or you'll lose your tenants.</string>
  <string id="17091">TALK ABOUT ZLATA GETTING HIT BY A CAR</string>
  <string id="17092">George, did you hear about Zlata Schimmer being hit by a car? What a tragedy!</string>
  <string id="17093">Life is full of tragedies, my friend... There is no light without darkness, no heat without cold...</string>
  <string id="17094">I'll probably paint a picture like this: "The lament of a desolate mother and the implacable wheels of doom."</string>
  <string id="17095">TALK ABOUT DONATING BLOOD</string>
  <string id="17096">George, have you heard that everyone is required to donate blood?</string>
  <string id="17097">My blood is seething with love and hate! Mind you, those are the ingredients for war...</string>
  <string id="17098">My blood onto the ground will be shed!</string>
  <string id="17099">The battlefield will soak it up to give...</string>
  <string id="17100">Another chance for it to thrive...</string>
  <string id="17101">May turn it into trees or blossoms that...</string>
  <string id="17102">Um, I'm stuck there. Of course, I'll donate blood, Hector!</string>
  <string id="17103">I believe, you're romanticizing the war beyond measure.</string>
  <string id="17104">As a creative individual, I can't do anything about my proclivities. Verse is simply born out of any situation, as if it has a life of its own.</string>
  <string id="17105">TALK ABOUT JEANNE'S ARREST</string>
  <string id="17106">George, was Jeanne arrested?</string>
  <string id="17107">That's it for me! I cannot live without my beloved Muse!</string>
  <string id="17108">I cannot live without her... No wine can dull this pain!</string>
  <string id="17109">I have to run away!</string>
  <string id="17110">What do you mean "run?" Where to and what from?</string>
  <string id="17111">Anywhere! From myself! From the unbearable agony! Ah, if only I could sacrifice myself to purchase her freedom!</string>
  <string id="17112">...</string>
  <string id="17113">TALK ABOUT EUTHANASIA</string>
  <string id="17114">Have you heard about the Blissful Sleep procedure?</string>
  <string id="17115">We're all asleep already, Hector.</string>
  <string id="17116">Does it matter if we wake up sooner or later?</string>
  <string id="17117">Are you drunk?</string>
  <string id="17118">Yes, but can anyone stay sober while in the thick of the nightmare that is this life?</string>
  <string id="17119">My heart is frozen... A sword is poised above my neck...</string>
  <string id="17120">What am I saying? Who's listening?</string>
  <string id="19073">SELL THE CHEMICAL (-500 reputation points)</string>
  <string id="19074">Let's resort to local measures. I have that amazing spray for only $500!</string>
  <string id="19075">Oh, it's all about the money again… Here, take those despised pieces of paper!</string>
  <string id="19076">Hector, I could've never imagined you stepping as low as selling detergents…</string>
  <string id="19077">I'm disappointed!</string>
  <string id="19698">What's left is to find a connoisseur who could appreciate my masterpiece. Are there any gourmands of contemporary art? </string>
  <string id="19699">In the Ministry, perhaps?</string>
  <string id="19700">I'll think about what I can do. Your statue is really unique.</string>
  <string id="17425">SAY HELLO</string>
  <string id="17426">Allow me to introduce myself! My name is Hector Medina. I'm the new building manager.</string>
  <string id="17427">My name is Khan van Megeren.</string>
  <string id="17428">I'm an alternative medicine professional and an honored health care worker in our great nation.</string>
  <string id="17429">I'm here to attend the medical academic conference. I'll be sharing my experiences and expertise.</string>
  <string id="17430">It's great to finally have a doctor as a tenant!</string>
  <string id="17431">My services are by no means cheap. I do only photo diagnosing for free.</string>
  <string id="17432">Is that possible?</string>
  <string id="17433">Nothing is impossible for a man like me. I've spent many years opening chakras and developing the mind's eye!</string>
  <string id="17434">ASK ABOUT ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE</string>
  <string id="17435">Pardon my ignorance, but what is alternative medicine?</string>
  <string id="17436">Alternative medicine is health care at its most advanced! Traditional doctors and their medicines have misled our people for decades.</string>
  <string id="17437">Medicines like aspirin and antibiotics don't help people, they harm them!</string>
  <string id="17438">But antibiotics save lives! They're the only remedy for infection when the body can't heal itself.</string>
  <string id="17439">You see? You're a victim of the propaganda! All those so-called drugs only interfere with the human biofield and hinder our connection to the universe!</string>
  <string id="17440">Alternative medicine is based on the theory that there's no need to treat the body; you only have to release its internal reserves!</string>
  <string id="17441">Our world contains endless sources of energy; you just need to learn how to tap into to them!</string>
  <string id="17442">So, how do you open these reserves when a patient is seriously ill?</string>
  <string id="17443">It's simple! I have dozens of exclusive ointments and balms which are guaranteed &lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#D53838FF&gt;to restore anyone to health&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt;!</string>
  <string id="17444">But they should only be used if fasting and urine therapy don't help.</string>
  <string id="17445">What? Did you say "urine therapy?"</string>
  <string id="17446">Why are you surprised? The human body contains everything it needs in order to health itself!</string>
  <string id="17447">I can see the people in our country accepting the idea of curative fasting, but drinking urine? Are you serious?</string>
  <string id="17448">The problem is you are stuck in your outdated understanding of medicine.</string>
  <string id="17449">Why, you probably think vaccinations are a good idea!</string>
  <string id="17450">What's wrong with vaccinations? How else can we prevent diseases?</string>
  <string id="17451">Certainly not by inoculating healthy people with malignant bacteria! It's barbaric!</string>
  <string id="17452">Thankfully, due to the shortage of antibiotics in this country, more and more citizens are turning to alternative methods of healing.</string>
  <string id="17453">TALK ABOUT THE DIFFERENT REMEDIES</string>
  <string id="17454">Hello, Khan! I, um, need your help.</string>
  <string id="17455">Ah ha! Have you finally decided to explore the wonders of alternative medicine? I have remedies for every occasion!</string>
  <string id="17456">All of them are charged with the positive energy of earth, air, water and fire, as evidenced in my certificates.</string>
  <string id="17457">CALEFACIENT</string>
  <string id="17458">Here's the problem: an old woman who lives here is always cold. She can't warm up or stop getting sick, and it's been a long time since we've had access to a mustard plaster.</string>
  <string id="17459">Can you do anything for her?</string>
  <string id="17460">Of course! I have a wonderful balm called Merry Dracaris. It warms up the joints and drives blood throughout the body!</string>
  <string id="17461">It costs $500.</string>
  <string id="17462">BUY</string>
  <string id="17463">Here's the money!</string>
  <string id="17464">And here's the jar.</string>
  <string id="17465">I'll come back with the money.</string>
  <string id="17466">END THE DIALOG</string>
  <string id="17467">REMEDY AGAINST FEAR</string>
  <string id="17468">Do you have anything that helps one to overcome fear? Some sort of sedative, perhaps?</string>
  <string id="17469">Yes, I have something that might help. It's very strong, and I haven't tested it yet, but have no fear!</string>
  <string id="17470">If you are afraid to drink it, just drink it! Hahaha! It's nothing complicated! A bit of amphetamine, a drop of ephedrine, motherwort extract and formalin with butyrate.</string>
  <string id="17471">I gave it a truly poetic name: "Face Your Monsters." Do you like it? You must admit that it's quite special!</string>
  <string id="17472">Here's the phial.</string>
  <string id="17473">A REMEDY FOR AMPUTEES</string>
  <string id="17474">A man, Murray Gibbs, lives in our building. Years ago, he was wounded in battle and lost his leg. To this day, he still feels pain in his limb, even though it's no longer there.</string>
  <string id="17475">Perhaps you have a drug that can alleviate his pain. He's a war veteran, and deserves to be helped.</string>
  <string id="17476">I just finished working on a delightful remedy called "Leg Grow!"</string>
  <string id="17477">It's very potent but he won't regret taking it! The results are stunning! He'll grow a new leg in under a minute!</string>
  <string id="17478">What do you mean by "grow?"</string>
  <string id="17479">I mean grow! This concoction releases the latent potential of the body to self-recover!</string>
  <string id="17480">There's an extra set of limbs inside everyone, and you can make them grow.</string>
  <string id="17481">Do you want it? It costs $500.</string>
  <string id="17482">A POTION TO IMPROVE ONE'S MENTAL PROWESS</string>
  <string id="17483">One of our neighbors, Johanne Bessler, is suffering from mental fatigue. Do you have anything that can increase the supply of blood to his brain?</string>
  <string id="17484">Look no further! Horse nostril extract mixed with a squeeze of boar prostate is excellent for stimulating the mental processes!</string>
  <string id="17485">It's called "Killer Descartes!" Johanne will have so many brilliant ideas, he won't be able to keep up with his own brain.</string>
  <string id="17486">Tell him to dilute three drops in 50 liters of water and drink it in the morning.</string>
  <string id="17487">A CURE FOR SORROW</string>
  <string id="17488">One of our tenants misses his late wife. Do you know of anything other than alcohol that can help one to overcome such deep sorrow?</string>
  <string id="17489">Hmmm... I can offer him an experimental potion called "Blast from the Past."</string>
  <string id="17490">How does it work?</string>
  <string id="17491">I don't know if it works or not; I haven't tested it yet.</string>
  <string id="17492">By theory, the patient's memories may appear to materialize.</string>
  <string id="17493">This should help him to cope with his painful memories and say goodbye to his loved one...</string>
  <string id="17494">Are you talking about hallucinations?</string>
  <string id="17495">What are memories but an illusion, a construct of our mind? Do you want it or not?</string>
  <string id="17496">PICK UP THE CONVERSATION LATER</string>
  <string id="17497">Honestly, I don't know what I need.</string>
  <string id="17498">Come back when you know. I have everything!</string>
  <string id="17499">TALK ABOUT DONATING BLOOD</string>
  <string id="17500">What do you think about the general populace being required to donate blood?</string>
  <string id="17501">It's a wicked practice. What if they bedevil you? I never even throw away my hair or nail clippings. I keep them at home.</string>
  <string id="17502">Professor Louser issued a report recently about the devastating effect of donkey dung on the human body.</string>
  <string id="17503">If you soak it in human blood, the blood will become diseased, even if you're a hundred miles away from someone!</string>
  <string id="17504">How can I entrust my blood to anyone? Nobody knows, after all, what they'll do with it later!</string>
  <string id="17505">However, everyone is required to donate.</string>
  <string id="17506">I should have prepared an invisibility balm a long time ago to hide from the authorities when they come to enforce these orders!</string>
  <string id="17507">By the way, your receding hairline attracts too much attention. Do you want to buy a hair growth paste for your head? Hair might also grow on your back, but I have a hair remover as well. I'll sell you both bottles at a discount!</string>
  <string id="17508">No thanks. I'm fine with the amount of hair on my head.</string>
  <string id="17509">Your loss. They say a bald head is a sign of a restless soul.</string>
  <string id="17510">ASK ABOUT A LOVE POTION</string>
  <string id="17511">Could you help me with something? I have a friend who's hopelessly in love with someone...</string>
  <string id="17512">I don't believe in love potions, but he's desperate and willing to resort to any method...</string>
  <string id="17513">Hmmm... I could come up with something... But I'll need a favor in return!</string>
  <string id="17514">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="17515">My research on neurolinguistic programming and aromatherapy symbiosis is quite expensive.</string>
  <string id="17516">I'd like to you to help me make the money I need.</string>
  <string id="17517">I have a box of my patented anti-itch tinctures, but I can't sell them to people who are feeling fine. I need to create, ummm, a market for them...</string>
  <string id="17518">How are we supposed to do that?</string>
  <string id="17519">I have an old blanket full of bedbugs from my last residence. I cut it up and put the pieces into plastic bags...</string>
  <string id="17520">You place one bag under each bed in your building, and when your tenants start to complain, I'll sell them my tincture!</string>
  <string id="17521">Are you crazy? That would be a horrible thing to do, not to mention illegal!</string>
  <string id="17522">Come on! De jure, it would be nothing more than a petty offense.</string>
  <string id="17523">A petty offense?</string>
  <string id="17524">Yes, and I'll pay you handsomely for helping me pull this off: $3,000!</string>
  <string id="17525">After I sell my tinctures, you can call the exterminators and arrange to have the apartments disinsected. Is it a deal?</string>
  <string id="17526">AGREE</string>
  <string id="17527">I can't believe I'm agreeing to this. Give me your bags.</string>
  <string id="17528">Relax! Nothing bad will happen!</string>
  <string id="17529">REFUSE</string>
  <string id="17530">No! I won't unleash a bed bug epidemic in my building!</string>
  <string id="17531">OK. That's your choice! But don't expect me to help you anymore!</string>
  <string id="17532">TALK ABOUT THE BAGS</string>
  <string id="17533">I fulfilled your request. The bed bug bags are in place. Now, it's time for you to make good on your end of the bargain.</string>
  <string id="17534">Thank you! You did me a solid! I'm going to sell every last one of my tinctures! Here's your money.</string>
  <string id="17535">Thank you! Now, what about your help with the love potion?</string>
  <string id="17536">Bring me a personal item of the victim.</string>
  <string id="17537">Victim?</string>
  <string id="17538">I mean patient! I need something personal to make the potion work.</string>
  <string id="17539">TALK ABOUT THE LOVE POTION</string>
  <string id="17540">I BROUGHT YOU A PERSONAL ITEM (A PURSE)</string>
  <string id="19718">I BROUGHT YOU A PERSONAL ITEM (A HAT)</string>
  <string id="17541">I brought you what you asked for. This hat belongs to Jeanne.</string>
  <string id="17542">Excellent choice; it'll work well. Wait here for a bit.</string>
  <string id="17543">...</string>
  <string id="17544">Done! Give this potion to your victim... I mean to Jeanne! Make sure she drinks it.</string>
  <string id="17545">I guarantee she'll fall head over heels in love with the person she works for.</string>
  <string id="17547">I brought you what you asked for. This purse belongs to Jeanne.</string>
  <string id="17548">ASK ABOUT THE PARROT</string>
  <string id="17549">I have a strange request. Do you by chance have a parrot - either alive or stuffed?</string>
  <string id="17550">Believe it or not, that's not the strangest request I've heard.</string>
  <string id="17551">I don't have a parrot, but I do have a stuffed crow! It'll work even better than a parrot! You won't have to feed it, it won't shit everywhere and it can't fly away. It'll be an excellent investment!</string>
  <string id="17552">BUY A STUFFED CROW ($1,000)</string>
  <string id="17553">Okay, give me your stuffed crow. I'll see what I can do with it.</string>
  <string id="17554">Great! Would you also be interested in a stuffed cat? I've got one in mind. It lives nearby, and it would make a great addition to the décor of any home!</string>
  <string id="17555">Pay me first and then you'll get what you need. That's the only way I do business!</string>
  <string id="17556">ASK ABOUT KHAN'S WORK</string>
  <string id="17557">Tell me about your work, Khan.</string>
  <string id="17558">I've devoted my life to healing people and studying the miraculous laws of our world...</string>
  <string id="17559">Both the obvious and the hidden ones. The stupids believe that the laws of physics and chemistry rule this world. What feeble minds!</string>
  <string id="17560">So what rules this world?</string>
  <string id="17561">Secret forces and mystical energies! And Master Talapoin, of course!</string>
  <string id="17562">What kind of miraculous laws? And who?!</string>
  <string id="17563">The higher a person's consciousness ascends, the more his or her life improves! It's possible to advance one's level of consciousness in just a few months.</string>
  <string id="17564">We even have an official club with membership fees and ID cards.</string>
  <string id="17565">Talapoin is the ruler of the Galactic Empire. He introduced the universal laws millions of years ago. These laws are still in operation today on our world!</string>
  <string id="17566">I see... I've heard of one of such law...</string>
  <string id="17567">It's called the Law of the Transformation of Human Stupidity into Bank Notes. Have you heard of it?</string>
  <string id="17568">I like your sense of humor, Hector.</string>
  <string id="17569">So you don't have a proper job?</string>
  <string id="17570">You're predictable, Hector. Countless people have meaningless jobs. Why must I be a sheep, falling in line with the herd?</string>
  <string id="17571">TALK ABOUT EUTHANASIA</string>
  <string id="17572">Have you heard about the Blissful Sleep procedure?</string>
  <string id="17573">What a sick procedure! It's such an inhuman solution to the challenge of old age!</string>
  <string id="17574">Elderly people could take part in experiments!</string>
  <string id="17575">Just imagine the resources that are wasted and the discoveries we could make! Just think of all the potions they could test!</string>
  <string id="17576">ASK WHAT HE NEEDS</string>
  <string id="17577">Do you want something?</string>
  <string id="17578">What the hell, Hector? You brought me a bed bug bag, too? My bed is full of tiny bloodsuckers!</string>
  <string id="17579">So use your tincture!</string>
  <string id="17580">That's not funny! I'm not going to waste my products on myself! Do something, Hector! Call the exterminators at once!</string>
  <string id="17581">TALK ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF LEG GROW</string>
  <string id="17582">A potion of yours has killed a man!</string>
  <string id="17583">That can't be true! My potions are 100 percent safe - assuming you follow the instructions...</string>
  <string id="17584">What instructions?!</string>
  <string id="17585">The instructions on the bottle. If this person had read them, he would have known the potion should be consumed only under a full moon...</string>
  <string id="17586">...while lying down with one's head pointed north! It's not my fault he didn't take what the label says seriously!</string>
  <string id="17587">TALK ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF FACE THE MONSTERS</string>
  <string id="17588">It wasn't the potion that killed him, it was his own fear!</string>
  <string id="17589">But the potion was supposed to help him overcome his fear!</string>
  <string id="17590">Sometimes, even alternative medicine can't help someone.</string>
  <string id="17591">Stop it, Hector. He would have died anyway, with or without the remedy. We have only lanced a deadly abscess on his soul.</string>
  <string id="17592">You goddamn quack!</string>
  <string id="17593">You're lucky that Saturn is in the Seventh House today. My astrologer says I can brush off any insult.</string>
  <string id="17594">TALK ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF MERRY DRACARIS</string>
  <string id="17595">The warming potion you gave me nearly burned Rosa Ranek!</string>
  <string id="17596">But that's what I said it would do, right? It's warming and stimulating, making her as good as new!</string>
  <string id="17597">TALK ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF BLAST FROM THE PAST</string>
  <string id="17598">The potion didn't killed him, guilt did. See the warnings listed on the label!</string>
  <string id="17599">"Do not use if you have strong feelings of guilt and your lifeline crosses your fate line on your left hand."</string>
  <string id="17600">It's not my fault when victims - I mean patients - ignore the instructions!</string>
  <string id="17601">TALK ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF KILLER DESCARTES</string>
  <string id="17602">I told you what the dosage should be: three drops diluted in 50 liters of water! I'm not responsible for those who ignore my instructions!</string>
  <string id="17603">How can you be so calm? Johanne exploded!</string>
  <string id="17604">Johanne Bessler became Johanne Burns!</string>
  <string id="17605">Is that supposed to be a joke? A man died, you heartless quack!</string>
  <string id="17606">Homeopathy has not been fully studied yet, Hector. I guess for further use, the dosage should be reduced to one drop per 200 liters of water.</string>
  <string id="19078">You've already bought 3 balsams from me. Would you like to try something special yourself?</string>
  <string id="19079">Like what? To be honest, I'm deeply attached to whatever is left of my life.</string>
  <string id="19080">Oh, I have a special offer for you. Since the first day, &lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#D53838FF&gt;I couldn't help but admire your cat.&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</string>
  <string id="19081">What an original name! You have a good taste, Hector.</string>
  <string id="19082">Your cat is steady and solid… as if it were part of our state apparatus.</string>
  <string id="19083">And his screams are impossible to ignore…</string>
  <string id="19084">That's true, screams like he's starving to death. But I know for sure he gets fed, and then also gets snacks from every tenant…</string>
  <string id="19085">Would you like to know, what exactly is your cat screaming about? His dreams, his desires?</string>
  <string id="19086">What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="19087">I got a recipe for a potion that helps you understand animal speech.</string>
  <string id="19088">I added Valerian root and powdered mouse bones, so it'll be easy to get your buddy's attention.</string>
  <string id="19089">It will cost next to nothing, mere $1000. For the trouble of catching mice and processing…</string>
  <string id="19090">BUY (-$1000)</string>
  <string id="19091">Sounds great. I'll buy it!</string>
  <string id="19092">I knew it!</string>
  <string id="19093">Drink at once, Hector! I must see this historical moment!</string>
  <string id="19094">I tried a weaker version of the potion myself, but mice aren't that great at small talk. You wouldn't imagine the nonsense they were saying.</string>
  <string id="19095">At least, now I know Mark Ranek keeps a can of roe in his apartment, and Rosa's leather shoes are delicious.</string>
  <string id="19096">Unfortunately, I don't have enough on me. I'll stop by later.</string>
  <string id="19097">REFUSE</string>
  <string id="19098">No, no way, this is impossible, I don't believe that stuff.</string>
  <string id="19099">Nonsense! Everything is possible; your scientists would've eaten their pants, if they only knew!</string>
  <string id="19100">BUY POTION</string>
  <string id="19101">I'm ready to buy your potion!</string>
  <string id="19327">Hector! I heard tenants complaining of bed bugs. I have a great spray against them! Trust me, bugs will be gone in a jiffy!</string>
  <string id="19328">Only $1000 for 5, best price in town!</string>
  <string id="19329">OK, I'll take it.</string>
  <string id="19330">Money first!</string>
  <string id="19331">I'd rather say no. That's suspicious: first the bugs, now you…</string>
  <string id="19332">You're missing out.</string>
  <string id="19352">I need your help, Hector!</string>
  <string id="19353">I'm on the verge of something great.</string>
  <string id="19354">Did you find a way to cure some horrible disease?</string>
  <string id="19355">In a way, yes, I suppose. And do you know what's in my way?</string>
  <string id="19356">What?</string>
  <string id="19357">A stack of mice!</string>
  <string id="19358">Mice? Are you insane, van Megeren? I have no time for jokes.</string>
  <string id="19359">I'm deadly serious. I need a stack of best field mice.</string>
  <string id="19360">I tried using white lab mice and regular rats, but that didn't work. I need field mice.</string>
  <string id="19361">What do you want of me?</string>
  <string id="19362">I saw your cat carrying one of those, and allowed myself to take it from him. That's exactly what I need!</string>
  <string id="19363">I'm sure you could pick up the mice your Order catches, and bring to me.</string>
  <string id="19364">But he eats them!</string>
  <string id="19365">If you feed your cat properly, Hector, he won't eat mice. He'd just bring them home, as prey, that's the hunting instinct.</string>
  <string id="19366">GIVE MICE</string>
  <string id="19367">I brought you mice. There, go ahead, towards your "something great"…</string>
  <string id="19368">Come here, my pretties! So fat, so cute!</string>
  <string id="19369">Thank you endlessly, Hector, you and your precious Order!</string>
  <string id="19493">DISCUSS THE ANIMAL TALK POTION</string>
  <string id="19494">That potion you gave me… It works!</string>
  <string id="19495">Huh! Of course it does!</string>
  <string id="19496">Do you have more?</string>
  <string id="19497">No, Hector, I only made one portion and do not intend to repeat. I am preoccupied with more urgent matters.</string>
  <string id="19706">If you have mice, bring them to me and I'll pay $250 per tail.</string>
  <string id="19707">SELL MICE</string>
  <string id="19708">I didn't come to you empty-handed…</string>
  <string id="19709">Excellent! Here's your money.</string>
  <string id="19710">Oh, it's a wholesale batch! Wonderful! </string>
  <string id="19711">Enough for now, Hector.</string>
  <string id="17698">SAY HELLO</string>
  <string id="17699">Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Hector Medina. I'm the manager of this building.</string>
  <string id="17700">My name is Jeanne Oehrn.</string>
  <string id="17701">Do you know George de Latour?</string>
  <string id="17702">Yes. I sometimes model for him. For some reason, he thinks I'm his muse.</string>
  <string id="17703">You do inspire him.</string>
  <string id="17704">I find those kinds of compliments strange. I'm not used to hearing things like that.</string>
  <string id="17705">Still, I'm glad for the opportunity to earn some money, and George is a gentleman. He hasn't made any untoward advances or asked me to do anything indecent.</string>
  <string id="17706">TALK ABOUT HER LIFE</string>
  <string id="17707">Tell me about yourself,</string>
  <string id="17708">Why are you interested in me?</string>
  <string id="17709">PERSUADE HER (-500 reputation points)</string>
  <string id="17710">I'm supposed to know everything about the people who live in my building. It's my job.</string>
  <string id="17711">Fine. I was married once, but it didn't work out.</string>
  <string id="17712">Why?</string>
  <string id="17713">I was a good girl, he was a bad guy. I fell in love like a fool. We were such a cliché!</string>
  <string id="17714">It wasn't anything like in the movies. He refused to settle down. All of my attempts to create a family environment for us angered him.</string>
  <string id="17715">Besides, my ex-husband was involved in illegal cock fighting, while I happened to be a well-bred lady. That was a deal breaker.</string>
  <string id="17716">Once we were divorced, I realized I was financially dependent on my husband.</string>
  <string id="17717">Is this why you work as a model?</string>
  <string id="17718">Yes. I have to earn my own living. It's not so bad. George is a kind man.</string>
  <string id="17719">I do think he's in love with me. That makes me feel sorry for him...</string>
  <string id="17720">You feel sorry for him? Isn't being loved a wonderful thing?</string>
  <string id="17721">Yes, but only when it’s mutual. I'll never be able to love someone again.</string>
  <string id="17722">Poor George...</string>
  <string id="17723">Excuse me, but my life is none of your business.</string>
  <string id="17724">LEAVE HER ALONE</string>
  <string id="17725">I express an interest in all of my tenants. I'm sorry; I didn't mean to upset you.</string>
  <string id="17726">My life is a private matter.</string>
  <string id="17727">TALK ABOUT GEORGE DE LATOUR</string>
  <string id="17728">What do you think about George?</string>
  <string id="17729">He's a nice man. He has good manners and pays me well. He lets me stay in his apartment without asking for anything in return.</string>
  <string id="17730">It's a good way to save on rent.</string>
  <string id="17731">What do you think of him as a person?</string>
  <string id="17732">Honestly? He reminds me of a sad poodle.</string>
  <string id="17733">A poodle?</string>
  <string id="17734">You know, the cute and fluffy kind with sad eyes. The kind that's fun to cuddle and care for.</string>
  <string id="17735">But no girl would want to be in a relationship with a poodle.</string>
  <string id="17736">That sounds unnatural...</string>
  <string id="17737">That's right!</string>
  <string id="17738">TRY TO ACQUIRE A PERSONAL ITEM</string>
  <string id="17739">Good afternoon, Jeanne. How are you? Are you still staying at George's?</string>
  <string id="17740">I'm fine, thanks, and yes, I'm still living in your building. Do you want something, Hector?</string>
  <string id="17741">Yes... I mean no... I mean... Never mind! I was just thinking about adding more flowers to the hallway. Do you think the tenants would like that?</string>
  <string id="17742">If I were to place them here, in the corner, for example...</string>
  <string id="17743">(Jeanne turns away)</string>
  <string id="17744">TAKE THE PURSE FROM HER POCKET</string>
  <string id="17745">(Hector snatches Jeanne's purse and quickly hides it behind his back.)</string>
  <string id="17746">I don't know, Hector... Flowers aren't my thing. It's up to you.</string>
  <string id="17747">DO NOTHING</string>
  <string id="17748">PERSUADE HER TO DRINK THE LOVE POTION</string>
  <string id="17749">I have an offer you can't refuse, Jeanne!</string>
  <string id="17750">What would that be?</string>
  <string id="17751">I want to treat you to this invigorating and health-boosting balsam.</string>
  <string id="17752">No thank you, Hector. I don't accept drinks from people I barely know.</string>
  <string id="17753">Besides, you offering me this is a little weird...</string>
  <string id="17754">PERSUADE HER (-500 reputation points)</string>
  <string id="17755">Think again before you refuse. You have an entire day of work ahead of you. An energy boost could be just the thing to get you through it.</string>
  <string id="17756">It's also been known to improve one's complexion. So what do you think? I have just have just one bottle of this stuff left.</string>
  <string id="17757">All one has to do around here to improve one's complexion is wash the coal dust off one's face.</string>
  <string id="17758">Then again, you never can tell what might happen... Give me your balsam!</string>
  <string id="17759">What kind of crap are you trying to give me? I'm not going to drink that!</string>
  <string id="17760">END THE DIALOG</string>
  <string id="17761">TALK ABOUT ART</string>
  <string id="17762">Modern art is a strange thing. It's supposed to be for the public, but the public doesn't understand it...</string>
  <string id="17763">One of the shop owners I know sells more still-lifes than anything else.</string>
  <string id="17764">You know, the appetizing ones with lots of delicious food: crusty meat and bread, slabs of Swiss cheese with huge holes...</string>
  <string id="17765">Which isn't surprising, as that sort of food long ago disappeared from our tables.</string>
  <string id="17766">That's it! What's the point of art if the people are hungry?</string>
  <string id="17767">TALK ABOUT DONATING BLOOD</string>
  <string id="17768">Have you heard about the blood donation initiative?</string>
  <string id="17769">You mean the deception the Ministry is using to hunt down those who have allegedly betrayed the motherland? Yes, I've heard about that. But I have nothing to fear.</string>
  <string id="17770">I can catch any traitor!</string>
  <string id="17772">I broke up with him! How could I have been so blind? He's a saboteur!</string>
  <string id="17773">Did you see that disgusting statue he made?</string>
  <string id="17774">You broke up with him?</string>
  <string id="17775">It's like scales fell off my eyes and I was able to see him for who he really is! He calls himself an artist! Ha! He's just a talentless hack who's wasting his time on trifles.</string>
  <string id="17776">Only smokers are more disgusting. They ruin their health instead of preserving it so they can serve their motherland!</string>
  <string id="17777">I understand now that all men are brutes and misogynists!</string>
  <string id="17778">What are you talking about?!</string>
  <string id="17779">I used to think I'd ever love again! Then all of a sudden, it dawned on me! You must love yourself and your country, not some primate who calls himself a man!</string>
  <string id="17780">I'm going to do everything I can to ensure that the voices of the forgotten women of this country are heard! Tomorrow, I'm going to apply for a job at the manufacturing plant!</string>
  <string id="17781">I will strive for equal rights and respect for every woman!</string>
  <string id="17782">It seems the balsam affected you differently than I was expecting.</string>
  <string id="17783">What are you mumbling about? Can't you speak clearly? I guess that's just one more thing that proves women are superior to men!</string>
  <string id="17784">A woman must be in control of all of her faculties!</string>
  <string id="17785">TALK ABOUT THE STATE OF THE COUNTRY</string>
  <string id="17786">Have you heard about the Wise Leader, who freed the musicians who stayed abroad for an extra day?</string>
  <string id="17787">Of course! Now everyone is talking about how kind and merciful he is.</string>
  <string id="17788">Has everyone forgotten about the imprisonment of the athletes who failed to bring home gold medals from the games?</string>
  <string id="17790">He shouldn't have done that. He should have imprisoned the traitors instead!</string>
  <string id="17791">My heart bleeds when I think about people who spend their lives trying to produce sounds from different objects.</string>
  <string id="17792">I would have given them axes and saws instead of musical instruments! Those lazy bums would be more useful if they were harvesting lumber.</string>
  <string id="18310">What? Can't you see we're busy?</string>
  <string id="18311">Stop interfering with our work, sir.</string>
  <string id="18312">Unless you'd like a face full of gas and a chance to bid this world goodbye...</string>
  <string id="18313">MEET</string>
  <string id="18314">Hello. My name is Hector. I'm the manager of this apartment building - for now...</string>
  <string id="18315">Good afternoon, comrade Hector! Murray Gibbs, staff sergeant, infantry regiment 10, reporting! I was honorably discharged due to &lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#D53838FF&gt;the loss of an extremity&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt;! at the Southern front.</string>
  <string id="18316">I have been temporarily allocated here!</string>
  <string id="18317">It's nice to meet you, Staff Sergeant Gibbs!</string>
  <string id="18318">ASK ABOUT WORK</string>
  <string id="18319">Do you work in the canteen?</string>
  <string id="18320">Yup! I'm assigned to the campus to which General Airel Johnson is coming.</string>
  <string id="18321">I've been with the field kitchen ever since the war started. It's an honor to be back on duty!</string>
  <string id="18322">I'm cooking for the draftees. It's like feeding cattle!</string>
  <string id="18323">What did you do before that?</string>
  <string id="18324">I was retired. I'm expecting to get an apartment and a raise in my pension any day now.</string>
  <string id="18325">Any day! What a great country this is. Some nations don't honor the people who are ready to die for it!</string>
  <string id="18326">ASK ABOUT THE WAR</string>
  <string id="18327">What it's like to be at war? Scary?</string>
  <string id="18328">Scary doesn't begin to describe it. There's nothing worse! Except maybe coming home drunk and with lipstick on your face on your wedding anniversary.</string>
  <string id="18329">That's pretty much why I signed up - to escape my spouse's wrath.</string>
  <string id="18330">You're married?</string>
  <string id="18331">Not anymore. She's with someone else. Has been for a long time. I'm married to the battlefield, although even she has become something of an ex-spouse...</string>
  <string id="18332">Do you miss war?</string>
  <string id="18333">Well, there's one thing I don't miss: the aftertaste of blast charges in my porridge. Ha ha ha! Civilians eat much better.</string>
  <string id="18334">ASK ABOUT HIS INJURY</string>
  <string id="18335">What happened to your leg?</string>
  <string id="18336">Like I told you, I was working for the field kitchen. It was winter, and conditions were harsh. Our enemy surrounded us and cut off our supply chain.</string>
  <string id="18337">My comrades were dying of cold and starvation. There was no food! We were so hungry, we dug through the snow in the ravines and harvested frozen grass...</string>
  <string id="18338">After a week of nettle-weed soup, I became desperate and... Well... To make a long story short, we had enough stew for a week! And we survived!</string>
  <string id="18339">Unbelievable! You made soup out of your leg?!</string>
  <string id="18340">Every soldier must do his duty. My duty was to feed my comrades.</string>
  <string id="18341">I received a medal for that.</string>
  <string id="18342">What a stunning story!</string>
  <string id="18343">We were storming an important hill. The enemy had secured every point of access with barbed wire, moats and land mines...</string>
  <string id="18344">At the top of the hill, the soldiers in a concrete pillbox were mowing down our troops like grass.</string>
  <string id="18345">I was charged with sneaking in at night and planting a bomb. It wasn't easy, and it was dangerous, but I made it. I immediately secured the backpack with the explosive...</string>
  <string id="18346">...and just as I turned on the timer, an enemy soldier appeared!</string>
  <string id="18347">Oh, no!</string>
  <string id="18348">Oh, yes! I was scared shitless. He immediately tried to stab me. The whole place was going to be blown to smithereens in about a minute, but we just stayed there, fighting.</string>
  <string id="18349">The next thing I knew, there was a deafening BOOM... I couldn't hear anything for a month. We were thrown aside, still fighting.</string>
  <string id="18350">In the heat of the battle, I grabbed something next to me - I thought it was a stick or a log - and kept hitting him with it until he went quiet.</string>
  <string id="18351">Oh, my! Was it...</string>
  <string id="18352">Yes. It was my leg! The guys wouldn't stop teasing me about it! They said I kicked one right through middle of the uprights that night...</string>
  <string id="18353">I even earned a medal for that... I'd rather have a new leg, but a medal is better than nothing.</string>
  <string id="18354">Actually, that's a really silly story. What actually happened was we were crossing the river and took a break. I took my boots off and saw my leg had turned black!</string>
  <string id="18355">So, they sent me to the hospital and amputated it immediately to prevent blood-poisoning.</string>
  <string id="18356">What sucks is that my leg had turned black because the dye in my uniform ran when I stepped into the river.</string>
  <string id="18357">That's horrible!</string>
  <string id="18358">It was! Half the unit lost their legs before they figured out what happened!</string>
  <string id="18359">We all received medals, of course. Useless, but shiny, medals.</string>
  <string id="18360">That's an incredible story! They were going to plant me behind enemy lines as a signal officer.</string>
  <string id="18361">That would've given us access to the most current data and made us aware of the enemy's every move.</string>
  <string id="18362">Our senior officers had a picture of the enemy officer and chose me because of my resemblance to him.</string>
  <string id="18363">There was only one issue: the photo revealed that he had only one leg. So I had to sacrifice it for the Motherland.</string>
  <string id="18364">They trained me for the mission for two years! The plan was simple: once we were there, the other men were  going to grab him and I was going to take his place.</string>
  <string id="18365">That was brave of you!</string>
  <string id="18366">Yeah, but our efforts turned out to be for nothing. Once we were there, we saw he had both legs!</string>
  <string id="18367">He was just fooling around in that photograph, pretending to be missing a limb.</string>
  <string id="18368">That's horrible!</string>
  <string id="18369">Tell me about it. Anyhow, while they were trying to decide what to do next, I served as a cook.</string>
  <string id="18370">Then I received a medal and was honorably discharged.</string>
  <string id="18371">ASK WHAT HE WANTS</string>
  <string id="18372">Hello, Murray. What do you want?</string>
  <string id="18373">I'm not sure you can help me. Even the doctors have lost all hope. At least you won't make it worse...</string>
  <string id="18374">Try me.</string>
  <string id="18375">My leg hurts like hell at night. Funny, huh? I don't have a leg, yet it hurts.</string>
  <string id="18376">Doctors call those phantom pains, and all I can do is wait until it's gone. But it's been several years already, and nothing's changed.</string>
  <string id="18377">As for our drugstores, simple necessities like iodine and bandages are hard to find, so forget about locating painkillers...</string>
  <string id="18378">If only you could get me something to easy my constant, excruciating pain... I'd be very grateful!</string>
  <string id="18379">I'll see what I can do.</string>
  <string id="18380">OFFER MURRAY LEG GROW</string>
  <string id="18381">Murray! I have just the thing for you! They say it'll help your leg!</string>
  <string id="18382">Really? You're my savior, Hector! Hand it over!</string>
  <string id="18383">There you go.</string>
  <string id="18384">It looks weird. You definitely didn't get this from a drugstore... But whatever! It's not like things could get any worse, right?</string>
  <string id="18385">Thank you, Hector!</string>
  <string id="18386">ASK WHAT HAPPENED</string>
  <string id="18387">Murray, you look tired. What's up?</string>
  <string id="18388">I don't know what to do. I've been a soldier all my life; it's all I know. When I was discharged, it hurt more than losing my leg.</string>
  <string id="18389">The only thing giving me a purpose in this world was my work at the canteen.</string>
  <string id="18390">That was the only place I could still feel alive. I could talk with fellow soldiers, listen to their stories...</string>
  <string id="18391">What happened to you?</string>
  <string id="18392">I just found out I'm not getting an apartment or a pension. After Johnson arrives, they'll write me off and take away my work permit.</string>
  <string id="18393">I was betrayed! I don't get it; why did they throw me out? It was different at war. It was kill or be killed, and your fellow soldiers were your family...</string>
  <string id="18394">I have no one here. On the battlefield, I drove a tank; they trusted me with equipment worth millions of dollars! Well, between meals, of course.</string>
  <string id="18395">Can I help you find a job?</string>
  <string id="18396">I doubt you'd find anything for this old veteran, but feel free, Hector.</string>
  <string id="18397">TELL MURRAY ABOUT THE JOB</string>
  <string id="18398">Good news, Murray. I saw an ad in the newspaper. Have you ever considered performing on stage?</string>
  <string id="18399">You want me to become an actor? Are you kidding me? I wouldn't stand a chance. Why would they want someone with just one leg?</string>
  <string id="18400">That's your advantage! They need someone to play a pirate, and who could be better than a one-legged veteran who's seen the best and worst life has to offer?</string>
  <string id="18401">I suppose no one... Okay, I'll give it a try.</string>
  <string id="18403">How did the audition go?</string>
  <string id="18404">Not well. A whole mess of one-legged people show up. You're not the only smart person around, Hector.</string>
  <string id="18405">I don't know what else we could do. Everyone's looking for a pirate costume; some folks are even considering removing an eye so they'll be given an eye patch.</string>
  <string id="18406">In other words, everyone's trying to stand out. I think the main pirate props are a bottle of rum and a parrot!</string>
  <string id="18407">But the stage is an alcohol-free zone, and I have no idea where I could get a parrot...</string>
  <string id="18408">A parrot, huh? I'll see what I can do.</string>
  <string id="18409">I'll let you know if something pops up.</string>
  <string id="18410">DISCUSS THE PARROT</string>
  <string id="18411">I found a parrot for you! A real one! Here! Now you're a shoo-in for the role!</string>
  <string id="18412">Thank you, Hector! You've gone beyond the call of duty for me. You would have made a great soldier.</string>
  <string id="18414">Murray, I brought you a stuffed bird.</string>
  <string id="18415">A parrot?</string>
  <string id="18416">Not quite... It's a crow.</string>
  <string id="18417">What good will that do me? It doesn't look like a parrot. However, if its feathers were colored...</string>
  <string id="18418">Colored feathers? I think I can help...</string>
  <string id="18419">Murray, I brought you a painted stuffed crow that looks just like a parrot. See?</string>
  <string id="18420">Hmmm... I guess that's better than nothing. Thanks!</string>
  <string id="18421">Blow up the audience, Murray!</string>
  <string id="18422">For Pete's sake, Hector, I don't have any explosives, and I don't intend to blow up anyone!</string>
  <string id="18423">Besides, I should try to make it through the auditions first...</string>
  <string id="18424">I messed up that phrase, Murray. What I meant to say was: I hope you get the part and become really popular!</string>
  <string id="18425">Great news, Hector! I landed the part! The opening night is coming up. It'll be amazing! I haven't been this happy in ages!</string>
  <string id="18426">Please come see the play in a month or so. I'll get you a free pass!</string>
  <string id="18427">That's great news! But I'm afraid I won't be able to make it to the play. In a month, I'll probably be gone.</string>
  <string id="18428">But I'm glad I was able to help you.</string>
  <string id="18429">I'm sad to hear that.</string>
  <string id="18430">In that case, here. It's my health permit. It's all I have to give to you.</string>
  <string id="18431">Perhaps you or someone else could use it. I know how hard it is to get papers nowadays.</string>
  <string id="18432">Who knows? It could save someone's life.</string>
  <string id="18433">Thank you, Murray! Good luck on the road to celebrity!</string>
  <string id="18434">DISCUSS THE HEALTH PERMIT</string>
  <string id="18435">How are you doing, Murray? I have a question for you.</string>
  <string id="18436">Shoot...</string>
  <string id="18437">You said you worked in the canteen. Does that mean you have a health permit? I need to know for my report.</string>
  <string id="18438">Of course. It's the only way I could work in the canteen.</string>
  <string id="18439">LIE AND TAKE THE BOOK (-1,000 reputation points)</string>
  <string id="18440">I need to copy it for the Ministry.</string>
  <string id="18441">Hmmm... That's a first... Well, you're the manager, so I guess you know what you're doing. Here you go.</string>
  <string id="18442">Make sure to give it back! This job is all I have left.</string>
  <string id="18443">I don't believe you, Hector. There's no way I'm going to give my health permit to you.</string>
  <string id="18444">END CONVERSATION</string>
  <string id="18445">Hector! Where's my health permit? You said you were only borrowing it. Give it back to me!</string>
  <string id="18446">What health permit? I don't recall borrowing anything from you...</string>
  <string id="18447">What? You rear-echelon motherf… I'm going to issue a complaint with the Board for Veterans!</string>
  <string id="18448">Stop yelling! You're not in the army anymore. Besides, if you continue to behave like this, the police will drag you away.</string>
  <string id="18449">Burn in hell, administrative rat!</string>
  <string id="18450">Hello, Murray.</string>
  <string id="18451">Screw you, weasel!</string>
  <string id="18621">Hi, Hector.</string>
  <string id="18622">PROVIDE THE DNA SAMPLES</string>
  <string id="18623">I'm here to give you the DNA samples.</string>
  <string id="18624">You're very slow, Hector. You know our work can't wait!</string>
  <string id="18625">I'm sorry. This won't happen again.</string>
  <string id="18626">Did you bring the samples?</string>
  <string id="18627">YES, SORTED BY NAME</string>
  <string id="18628">Thank you for your service. Take care.</string>
  <string id="18629">NOT YET</string>
  <string id="18630">Do you think I love standing here? Do you think I have nothing better to do?</string>
  <string id="18631">DISCUSS ZLATA'S SAMPLE</string>
  <string id="18632">Here you go. It's urgent! Can you process this one next?</string>
  <string id="18633">Comrade Hector! Directive number 321458 prohibits altering the data processing order. I could be executed for breaking that rule! Or, worse, I could be fired!</string>
  <string id="18634">Please! It's important; a child's life depends on it. I'll do anything!</string>
  <string id="18635">Anything, huh? Hmmm... I need a rare item. It's currently banned.</string>
  <string id="18636">I believe there's an artist living in your building. Order him to paint a naked woman...</string>
  <string id="18637">I need this for my, um, personal research on human anatomy!</string>
  <string id="18638">Uh, are you sure you wouldn't rather just bribe me?</string>
  <string id="18639">I could report you for that!</string>
  <string id="18640">OK, I'll try.</string>
  <string id="18641">Here's the sample. I suspect that's the girl that went missing.</string>
  <string id="18642">What's this? A bone? That's awful! Did you find it in your building?</string>
  <string id="18643">Yes. I hope you'll process it next.</string>
  <string id="18644">I know the procedures. We'll be in touch.</string>
  <string id="18645">Did you bring me a sample? I don't have much time.</string>
  <string id="18646">Not yet.</string>
  <string id="18647">GIVE HIM THE PAINTING</string>
  <string id="18648">I have what you want.</string>
  <string id="18649">Careful! Someone could see us! Give me the sample.</string>
  <string id="18650">So, will you process it next?</string>
  <string id="18651">Sure. You'll have the results within a day.</string>
  <string id="18652">Where's the sample? If you don't bring something suitable for DNA analysis, I won't be able to help you.</string>
  <string id="18653">END CONVERSATION</string>
  <string id="19317">I'm waiting for you to bring me the stuff I need.</string>
  <string id="19318">GIVE ZLATA'S DNA</string>
  <string id="19319">For how much longer do I have to wait?</string>

  <string id="18929">Come here, kitty. I've had a rough day, too...</string>
  <string id="19492">Though I didn't spend my day on my side, scratching the chair. Obviously, you've been much busier than me.</string>
  <string id="18930">TALK</string>
  <string id="19409">Sucks to be you, buddy.</string>
  <string id="19410">So is mine.</string>
  <string id="18932">Stop whining and feed me!</string>
  <string id="18933">What?</string>
  <string id="18934">Feed me!</string>
  <string id="18936">You're panicking instead of looking for solutions.</string>
  <string id="18937">All of you humans are like that. So are mice.</string>
  <string id="19411">Every problem has multiple solutions.</string>
  <string id="19412">Order! You can talk?</string>
  <string id="19413">No, you can listen and respond now. Did that nice person teach you? You smell like his herbs and mice.</string>
  <string id="19414">I can't believe it! It worked!</string>
  <string id="19415">Is that all you want to discuss?</string>
  <string id="19416">I… I don't know, you're my buddy, I often talk to you.</string>
  <string id="19417">You're a good man, Hector.</string>
  <string id="19418">You saved me that winter, warmed me up and took into your home. I want to thank you.</string>
  <string id="19419">You, people, like money. That's so weird. Cats couldn't care less. But I can find it, though, cause I can smell it.</string>
  <string id="19420">But, Order, I don't want to take someone's money!</string>
  <string id="19421">Listen, while you still can.</string>
  <string id="19422">There is a cache in the house foundation, on the right, behind the rock. I hear rats squabbling there, this is painful…</string>
  <string id="19423">I can hear them, but not get them. And it smells like money.</string>
  <string id="19424">I don't know what to say, Order…</string>
  <string id="19425">Say nothing. Words are cheap and don't matter.</string>
  <string id="19426">What does?</string>
  <string id="19427">What matters the most, Hector, is… meow!</string>

  <string id="19103">I'm Hector Medina, the manager of the apartment block.</string>
  <string id="19104">I'm Johanne Bessler, an inventor.</string>
  <string id="19105">Trying to make our world a bit more convenient. I've already applied for 153 patents in the last 10 years!</string>
  <string id="19106">How many of them did you get?</string>
  <string id="19107">4 so far. But I'm only starting my journey to become the greatest inventor of our time!</string>
  <string id="19108">DISCUSS WORK</string>
  <string id="19109">What do you do for living?</string>
  <string id="19110">Ever since I can remember, I'm always busy inventing and constructing. Take alarm clocks apart and assemble them back together, as my father used to say.</string>
  <string id="19111">I applied for state funding. They choose one young inventor with potential, and pay for one of his projects.</string>
  <string id="19112">The winner gets to go to the capital and work in the best construction labs.</string>
  <string id="19113">I could never even dream of this!</string>
  <string id="19114">I'm sure you'll succeed.</string>
  <string id="19115">Alas, it's not up to me. All applicants are scrutinized.</string>
  <string id="19116">There's several hundreds of them…</string>
  <string id="19117">I heard they even review pedigree, to avoid a scandal, like they had three years ago.</string>
  <string id="19118">What scandal?</string>
  <string id="19119">They financed a guy, and he turned out to be a revolutionist. Came up with a propaganda speech when been live during the awards ceremony.</string>
  <string id="19120">He managed to say a lot before he was tied up and carried away. Though I have no clue, what exactly he was saying, cause all the viewers had to sign the confidentiality agreement. They even did an exemplary execution.</string>
  <string id="19121">Though, what really bothers me is that I'm running out of ideas. As if… me head refuses to work…</string>
  <string id="19122">DISCUSS BRAIN POTION</string>
  <string id="19123">I found a great potion for you, it's called 'Crazy Decart'.</string>
  <string id="19124">Drink it in the morning, 3 drops per 15 gallons of water; that will bring your inspiration back.</string>
  <string id="19125">Three drops per 15 gallons? Where am I expected to get that much water?</string>
  <string id="19126">As an experienced manuals writer, I must let you know this is utter nonsense!</string>
  <string id="19127">I will drink all of it at once; this won't hurt.</string>
  <string id="19128">I'd rather not, if I were you. Experimental potion, they must've known what they were talking about in the manual…</string>
  <string id="19129">There is no such thing as too many ideas, Hector!</string>
  <string id="19130">DISCUSS FUNDING</string>
  <string id="19135">I heard you couldn't get the funding. Sorry about that.</string>
  <string id="19136">Sorry about what? Ruining my career?!</string>
  <string id="19137">Don't you think they told me it was your speech that forever left me out of the engineering world?</string>
  <string id="19138">I hate you!</string>
  <string id="19139">DISCUSS THE EXPLOSION</string>
  <string id="19140">What are you doing?!!</string>
  <string id="19141">Just a failed experiment.</string>
  <string id="19142">Such a lousy inventor can't go without making mistakes, right? Right, Hector, the Power Broker?</string>
  <string id="19143">Consider yourself lucky it wasn't your apartment!</string>
  <string id="19144">DISCUSS BED BUGS</string>
  <string id="19145">What's up?</string>
  <string id="19146">Bed bugs!</string>
  <string id="19147">They're coming from the downstairs apartments! But I don't lose hope. I made a device that sucks them in!</string>
  <string id="19148">A bed bug vacuum?</string>
  <string id="19149">I call it Bugminator 3700.</string>
  <string id="19150">Why 3700?</string>
  <string id="19151">That's the amount I had to pay in fines for testing my first invention.</string>
  <string id="19152">I made a radio amplifier to listen to it outside during the annual clean-up.</string>
  <string id="19153">Something went wrong, and the sound wave shattered all the windows… Ah, good old times…</string>
  <string id="19154">ASK WHAT HE WANTS</string>
  <string id="19155">I got the grant! Help me decide…</string>
  <string id="19156">I came up with several inventions, and can't choose which one to proceed with.</string>
  <string id="19157">Tell me about it.</string>
  <string id="19158">PORTABLE PHONE</string>
  <string id="19159">This will be epic! Calling right from the car! Our officials will love it!</string>
  <string id="19160">According to my calculations, it will weigh about 130 lbs., but I already designed a cart!</string>
  <string id="19161">A cart? What's next, an engine?</string>
  <string id="19162">You're a genius, Hector! Why didn't I think of it?</string>
  <string id="19163">Huh, they'll be able to ride a telephone booth!</string>
  <string id="19164">Are you mocking me? I'm adamant that will be a real breakthrough!</string>
  <string id="19165">AGREE</string>
  <string id="19166">I'm sure it's a breakthrough! You will perfect your invention, and make it small enough to carry in a purse!</string>
  <string id="19167">BACK TO OPTIONS</string>
  <string id="19168">It's a tough decision. What are the other options?</string>
  <string id="19169">TELEPORT</string>
  <string id="19170">That's amazing. Picture it: going to work straight from home in no time!</string>
  <string id="19171">Our people will be able to work more. Or, we could teleport our troops straight into the enemy capital and take over!</string>
  <string id="19172">Wait a second. What if a criminal decides to steal from my office, or from the Ministry of Economy safe?</string>
  <string id="19173">Why would someone do that? I'm positive all of our comrades are honest people. If they don't have to waste time commuting, they'll have more of it to ponder the meaning of life.</string>
  <string id="19174">And other important matters. Everyone will be honest!</string>
  <string id="19175">Oh, Johanne, you underestimate our people. I'm afraid half of the country will teleport to another planet…</string>
  <string id="19176">And will live their old ways there! You can't run away from a problem, unless it's a pack of rabid dogs!</string>
  <string id="19177">You're right about the pack… But it does sound like something new and useful.</string>
  <string id="19178">Really?</string>
  <string id="19179">Yes, I'm sure. You should choose this one.</string>
  <string id="19180">SHAGOHOD WALKING CANNON</string>
  <string id="19181">This will change warfare as we know it! Imagine a giant walking machine strolling through the battlefield, shooting giant cannons!</string>
  <string id="19182">And in days of peace, they can carry loads. That will be awesome!</string>
  <string id="19183">Load carriers won't side with you here.</string>
  <string id="19184">Those wonderful people can learn some other great trade.</string>
  <string id="19185">Well… That's pretty ambitious…</string>
  <string id="19186">You think so?</string>
  <string id="19187">Absolutely. You should proceed with this one!</string>
  <string id="19188">CLEAREYE OPTI DEVICE</string>
  <string id="19189">Most of the people I know hate going to the doctor. You know how it is.</string>
  <string id="19190">I will revolutionize healthcare! I will create a system of monitors, analyzing the health status and compiling a report with recommendations.</string>
  <string id="19191">Equipped with: helmet, wetsuit, wires and automated typewriter. The only thing people will have to do is add paper…</string>
  <string id="19192">And how long does it take?</string>
  <string id="19193">12 to 20 hours, nothing to talk about.</string>
  <string id="19194">Eventually, I plan to add the stress measurement and prevention module.</string>
  <string id="19195">Stress prevention? What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="19196">Automassage and sedation. They can sleep while still in the suit!</string>
  <string id="19197">What do you say?</string>
  <string id="19198">Sounds nice, we could use private doctors…</string>
  <string id="19199">DISCUSS BLOOD DONATION</string>
  <string id="19200">Did you see the bloodmobile by the house?</string>
  <string id="19201">Yes, what an awful vehicle. I bet you half of the blood turns unusable before they even make it to the hospital.</string>
  <string id="19202">I should come up with an alternative. Flying bloodmobiles with cooling… shaped like a red drop… That's awesome!</string>
  <string id="19203">DISCUSS WAR</string>
  <string id="19204">What do you think of war?</string>
  <string id="19205">I don't think, I'm busy inventing. Doing all I can to help the country.</string>
  <string id="19206">Just finished designing a tank with all-round cannons. They will shoot in all directions at once!</string>
  <string id="19207">And hit allies?</string>
  <string id="19208">Hm, I haven't considered that possibility…</string>
  <string id="19209">END CONVERSATION</string>
  <string id="19210">MEET</string>
  <string id="19211">I'm Hector Medina, the manager of the apartment block.</string>
  <string id="19212">I'm Lionel Kramer.</string>
  <string id="19213">I'm a writer, collecting data for my new book…</string>
  <string id="19214">How many have you published already, Lionel?</string>
  <string id="19215">This is my first one.</string>
  <string id="19216">I see. Just sounded like you had books published before.</string>
  <string id="19217">Don't see anything wrong with that. This book WILL be a new one.</string>
  <string id="19218">DISCUSS THE SKELETON IN THE CLOSET</string>
  <string id="19219">Lionel, why do you keep a skeleton in the closet?! Where did it come from?!</string>
  <string id="19220">You know, Hector… This is my late wife, I loved her very much… So much, that couldn't part with her when she passed away.</string>
  <string id="19221">I just couldn't bury her. I understand that looks crazy, but try to believe me…</string>
  <string id="19222">Her presence comforts me…</string>
  <string id="19223">How do I know you're not lying?</string>
  <string id="19224">You don't. You either trust me, or report me. In any case, you'd think I'm insane.</string>
  <string id="19225">So all I can do is pray for your mercy.</string>
  <string id="19226">I have to think about it.</string>
  <string id="19227">Hector… Since you know my secret now… And in case you decide to not report my… peculiarities…</string>
  <string id="19228">Please, help me…</string>
  <string id="19229">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="19230">I'm not here for long. But leaving without my wife…</string>
  <string id="19231">I need a big suitcase to transport her, and the one I had is ruined. Please, help me find one.</string>
  <string id="19232">And I swear you'll never hear from me again.</string>
  <string id="19233">AGREE</string>
  <string id="19234">OK, I'll help you.</string>
  <string id="19235">REFUSE</string>
  <string id="19236">I can't help you. I'm still trying to digest what I just heard.</string>
  <string id="19237">DISCUSS HIS WIFE</string>
  <string id="19238">What happened to your wife? I've never seen anyone carrying around a… skeleton before.</string>
  <string id="19239">It's a long story.</string>
  <string id="19240">We were inseparable… One life, one love. But once I was away, and she died, and I can't forgive myself for leaving her.</string>
  <string id="19241">I promised her I'll never leave her again. So, that's how it is now.</string>
  <string id="19242">I wish I could talk to her spirit and beg for forgiveness. Oh, Gabriella…</string>
  <string id="19243">Ehm, and how did you… well… got rid of… How did you get the bones clean? Sorry for asking.</string>
  <string id="19244">Oh, regular acid, nothing special. I couldn't soil the whiteness of my beloved one's bones with rotting flesh...</string>
  <string id="19245">I polish the bones every day.</string>
  <string id="19246">Hate dirt.</string>
  <string id="19247">DISCUSS PAST EXPLOSION BALM</string>
  <string id="19248">I know how to make it easier for you. I have that balm, it allows you to meet the deceased.</string>
  <string id="19249">Sounds weird. Is it hallucinogenic?</string>
  <string id="19250">I was told that'll help to pacify your conscience, to have a closure.</string>
  <string id="19251">Sounds interesting. I'd rather be alone doing so, though. If you don't mind.</string>
  <string id="19252">DISCUSS SUITCASE</string>
  <string id="19253">Lionel, I got you a suitcase. Hope it's big enough. And hope to never see you and your skeletons again!</string>
  <string id="19254">Thank you, Hector, I promise you won't hear from me again… Well, hear about me - maybe.</string>
  <string id="19255">What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="19256">I meant my book, Hector. This way or another, but I'll be famous!</string>
  <string id="19257">DISCUSS THE MURDER</string>
  <string id="19258">Lionel! I know everything! It's you!</string>
  <string id="19259">What are you talking about, Hector?</string>
  <string id="19260">You are the white-gloved murderer! It's you the newspapers are talking about!</string>
  <string id="19261">How could I believe that foolish wife story?! You abduct women and kill them!</string>
  <string id="19262">What should I do to you now?!</string>
  <string id="19263">No, no! Anything but that! You don't understand! I'm not killing them, I'm releasing them! Setting them free from that horrible world of suffering!</string>
  <string id="19264">They suffer from the dirt around and within them… I'm freeing their souls!</string>
  <string id="19265">I can't leave them be in this world. Please, don't tell on me! I'll give you all my money!</string>
  <string id="19266">OK, hand it over and get lost.</string>
  <string id="19267">Thank you, Hector, it's all I have!</string>
  <string id="19268">Get out of my apartment block! Today!</string>
  <string id="19269">Oh no, I won't let you go so easily. I wanted to know what your motives were. Now I see you're nothing but a monster, hiding behind illusions and lame excuses!</string>
  <string id="19270">And now they'll get you, put you in a cage, leave there for a while to ponder, and then 'release' with 2700V.</string>
  <string id="19271">You're wrong, Hector. I'm a nobody, the state couldn't care for me less.</string>
  <string id="19272">So keep your threats to yourself. If you really had evidence, you would've already reported me.</string>
  <string id="19273">DISCUSS BOOKS</string>
  <string id="19274">What is your favorite genre?</string>
  <string id="19275">I like plot twists, Hector. Sometimes, you can get one in kid books; sometimes, even in anatomy textbooks!</string>
  <string id="19276">When the story winds around the bone, like a muscle, and the reader's thought cuts it, like a razor, and sense is pouring out of the cut throat…</string>
  <string id="19277">What the hell are you talking about?!</string>
  <string id="19278">Oh… Sorry, I got carried away… I should write that down…</string>
  <string id="19279">To cut a long story short, I like different books.</string>
  <string id="19280">DISCUSS THE WHITE-GLOVED MURDERER</string>
  <string id="19281">Have you heard of the last crime by the white-gloved murderer?</string>
  <string id="19282">What do they say?</string>
  <string id="19283">Found another body. Right under the bridge. I used to cross that bridge on the bus before.</string>
  <string id="19284">And now they find this poor woman there… Naked, destroyed. Someone's daughter, sister, mother…</string>
  <string id="19285">Who could do that to a woman?!</string>
  <string id="19286">Perhaps, the criminal has a goal. Maybe, he's trying to send a message to the world.</string>
  <string id="19287">What message could that barbarism convey?</string>
  <string id="19288">He brutally murders women, but first undresses them completely, for whatever reason, and puts white gloves on them.</string>
  <string id="19289">The newspapers say it's his signature. Why gloves? What signature? Is he a janitor?</string>
  <string id="19290">Why necessarily a janitor? Perhaps, he thinks he's on a great mission. Like a surgeon, removing cancer cells.</string>
  <string id="19291">Like a director, orchestrating the symphony of other lives…</string>
  <string id="19292">Are you trying to justify his actions?!</string>
  <string id="19293">Not at all! Murders are so horrible. I completely agree with you.</string>
  <string id="19294">I must go now. Got things to do.</string>
  <string id="19295">DISCUSS NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS</string>
  <string id="19296">You're into criminal stats? Why?</string>
  <string id="19297">Since when is collecting newspaper clippings illegal?</string>
  <string id="19298">I'm a writer, I write detective stories, so this helps me to gather material.</string>
  <string id="19299">ASK WHAT HE WANTS</string>
  <string id="19300">Medina, could you lock your cat in the basement?</string>
  <string id="19301">&lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#D53838FF&gt;I hate animals&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, I must leave in a clean place. Both physically and spiritually.</string>
  <string id="19302">And those dirty animals destroy my harmony. Sometimes I want to hurt them, but forbid myself.</string>
  <string id="19303">No way! This is the only living being I'm really attached to.</string>
  <string id="19304">Mind you, if something happens to Order, you'll be in major trouble!</string>
  <string id="19305">Sorry, it's just that I avoid animals all my life.</string>
  <string id="19306">Do you have kids, Hector?</string>
  <string id="19307">Yes, a son, he's 30.</string>
  <string id="19308">Too bad you don't have a younger daughter. Two kid families are perfect!</string>
  <string id="19309">Sometimes I just don't get you, Lionel.</string>
  <string id="19310">END CONVERSATION</string>
  <string id="19311">Hector! Someone's been frisking my room! I'm sure it was you! You saw something very private. I won't put up with this!</string>
  <string id="19312">I will report you!</string>
  <string id="19313">Nobody has the right to touch my wife's remnants!</string>
  <string id="19314">I…</string>
  <string id="19315">I'm not inclined to listen to your excuses.</string>
  <string id="19501">MEET</string>
  <string id="19502">Greetings, I'm Hector Medina, the manager.</string>
  <string id="19503">I'm Christopher Danson, Ministry of Order Field Officer.</string>
  <string id="19504">My wife and I are supposed to be issued an apartment in section B; we will be temporarily staying at your building.</string>
  <string id="19505">DISCUSS BLOOD DONATION</string>
  <string id="19506">Have you heard of bloodmobiles?</string>
  <string id="19507">You bet! Three days ago we were guarding one, three of the "outsorts" attacked poor nurse…</string>
  <string id="19508">"Outsorts"?</string>
  <string id="19509">People with inherited illnesses, those "genetic traitors".</string>
  <string id="19510">So it's true… I thought it was an evil joke.</string>
  <string id="19511">Joke! Three labor camps are already open and welcoming the "outsorts"!</string>
  <string id="19512">Oh…</string>
  <string id="19513">DISCUSS WAR</string>
  <string id="19514">What's up front?</string>
  <string id="19515">What do you mean, Hector?</string>
  <string id="19516">War is the cauldron of violence devouring our age…</string>
  <string id="19517">You're a poet, Christopher.</string>
  <string id="19518">Those are the words of a pacifist we sent to jail for 20 years. He was handing out anti-war flyers.</string>
  <string id="19519">DISCUSS BEATING HIS WIFE</string>
  <string id="19520">I saw you beat your wife!</string>
  <string id="19521">What do you care about my life?</string>
  <string id="19522">MAKE DEROGATORY COMMENT</string>
  <string id="19523">That's unacceptable!</string>
  <string id="19524">Get out while you can!</string>
  <string id="19525">ASK WHAT'S UP (-500 reputation points)</string>
  <string id="19526">Christopher, you must be aware of my job responsibilities. I can't let the fact of domestic battery go unnoticed.</string>
  <string id="19527">I'm stranded here, Hector. It's not what you think it is.</string>
  <string id="19528">But, it's hard to explain. I beat my wife, because she wants it.</string>
  <string id="19529">I don't understand, Christopher. Is this some sort of a joke?</string>
  <string id="19530">No, I mean it. Her job is very emotionally demanding, and at home she… You must know, I'll never hurt her!</string>
  <string id="19531">It's hard to believe, but I'm against violence. There's too much of it in my life.</string>
  <string id="19532">What do you mean?</string>
  <string id="19533">I've been a police officer for over 15 years. You should know what I mean. People are afraid of cops. My subordinates are afraid of me. &lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#D53838FF&gt;I'm afraid of my boss.&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</string>
  <string id="19534">My boss is afraid of his boss, his boss is afraid of the minister… And it's the same in any government body. A chain of fear and cruelty.</string>
  <string id="19535">If only you knew, how tired I am of all this…</string>
  <string id="19536">Honestly, I'm surprised…</string>
  <string id="19537">My father has been beating me all my childhood. Thought that to be the best way of upbringing.</string>
  <string id="19538">When I turned 15, I escaped into the army; dreamt of coming back and kicking his ass. But after I came back, I realized it wasn't good life that turned him into this, and that I couldn't change him.</string>
  <string id="19539">He believes a strong one should show his strength, or get eaten.</string>
  <string id="19540">You don't see him very often, I believe?</string>
  <string id="19541">That's right. He moved far away recently.</string>
  <string id="19542">He still loves a good fight, even though he's almost 90.</string>
  <string id="19543">What? 90?!</string>
  <string id="19544">But what about euthanasia?</string>
  <string id="19545">Oh, I meant 70.</string>
  <string id="19546">That's enough.</string>
  <string id="19547">Wait, I got an invitation… I won't make it till fall. Please!</string>
  <string id="19548">That's enough, Hector.</string>
  <string id="19549">Hector! Do you realize the difference between us? You're a nobody, I'm a Ministry of Order Officer! Don't try to press me.</string>
  <string id="19550">END CONVERSATION</string>
  <string id="19551">That's none of my business, I'm sorry.</string>
  <string id="19552">ASK ABOUT FATHER</string>
  <string id="19553">Christopher, it's vital for me, if your father really is almost 90, I have one question. How did he avoid euthanasia?!!</string>
  <string id="19554">I told you, you're wrong.</string>
  <string id="19555">I can tell it's time to put you to rest. You're half-deaf!</string>
  <string id="19556">Christopher, it's vital for me, I have proof you're covering up for your father!</string>
  <string id="19557">How did he avoid euthanasia?!!</string>
  <string id="19558">You have me cornered, Hector.</string>
  <string id="19559">He is alive, indeed. But I can't tell you anything else.</string>
  <string id="19560">CONTINUE CONVERSATION (-500 reputation points)</string>
  <string id="19561">My wife works in the euthanasia center, and I served at the border. I've got connections.</string>
  <string id="19562">&lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#D53838FF&gt;Together, we saved all of our elderly relatives, and shipped them abroad.&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</string>
  <string id="19563">ASK FOR HELP (-1000 reputation points)</string>
  <string id="19564">Save me!</string>
  <string id="19565">Talk to my wife. Without her, you're doomed. I can't order her, she risks more than just her job.</string>
  <string id="19566">Hector! Do you realize the difference between us? You're a nobody, I'm a Ministry of Order Officer! Don't try to press me.</string>
  <string id="19567">MAKE HIM HELP</string>
  <string id="19568">You must help me, or I'll send you to jail! I've got evidence, your father's letter!</string>
  <string id="19569">Okay, Hector. But beware, you might regret this.</string>
  <string id="19570">…</string>
  <string id="19571">When it's time for you to go to the Euthanasia Center, I'll make sure you don't make it to there.</string>
  <string id="19572">What will you do to me?</string>
  <string id="19573">Afraid? Too late for this, Hector. First you threaten me, now you're scared?</string>
  <string id="19574">After you get in our car, you'll have a heart attack, and we'll take the body to the morgue. Any body. My sister works there, so it shouldn't be a problem.</string>
  <string id="19575">What you are to do with your life after that, is none of my business.</string>
  <string id="19576">TALK LATER</string>
  <string id="19577">DISCUSS EUTHANASIA</string>
  <string id="19578">You said you saved your elderly relatives.</string>
  <string id="19579">ASK WHAT HE WANTS</string>
  <string id="19580">What do you want?</string>
  <string id="19581">About euthanasia… You've made a deal with Gertrude. We'll help you.</string>
  <string id="19582">Here's the plan: you'll be taken to the Euthanasia Venter. Don't worry, the policemen will bit you up a bit to make it look believable.</string>
  <string id="19583">Gertrude will meet you at the Center. She'll use sleeping aid instead of poison. You'll wake up on a boat.</string>
  <string id="19584">Take money with, Hector. The more you have, the better off you'll be on the other shore.</string>
  <string id="19585">Can I take my cat?</string>
  <string id="19586">Your cat? Should I order a personal jet for it?</string>
  <string id="19587">What do you think of airborne animals, Hector? I've heard the Minister of Economy has a personal plane for his dog.</string>
  <string id="19588">I mean it! It's important for me!</string>
  <string id="19589">Okay. Don't see why should this be a problem.</string>
  <string id="19590">DISCUSS AGREEMENT</string>
  <string id="19591">I'm here to discuss our agreement.</string>
  <string id="19592">I have nothing more to say, Hector. As soon as your time is up, or you volunteer for the Blissful Sleep, my guys will take care of it.</string>
  <string id="19593">We'll see, it might even be my shift. In any case, you won't get to the Euthanasia Center.</string>
  <string id="19594">Will you stick to your word?</string>
  <string id="19595">I will.</string>
  <string id="19596">DISCUSS HARD LABOR</string>
  <string id="19597">You said you were uncomfortable at your workplace.</string>
  <string id="19598">My coworkers are aggressive idiots. My boss is always furious, and those doughnuts he keeps munching on have made him huge.</string>
  <string id="19599">Are you afraid of him?</string>
  <string id="19600">I suppose. Yes, you're right.</string>
  <string id="19601">OFFER WAY TO COPE WITH FEAR</string>
  <string id="19602">Christopher, you told me you had issues getting along with your boss.</string>
  <string id="19603">I've a great potion against fear. Would you like some?</string>
  <string id="19604">What harm could it possibly do… Hand it over.</string>
  <string id="19605">MEET</string>
  <string id="19606">I'm Hector Medina, the manager of the apartment block.</string>
  <string id="19607">I'm Gertrude Danson. Pleased to meet you, Hector.</string>
  <string id="19608">What is your occupation? That's for my report.</string>
  <string id="19609">I'm a nurse.</string>
  <string id="19610">So, do you work in the hospital, then?</string>
  <string id="19611">I can't tell you, Hector. State secrecy.</string>
  <string id="19612">DISCUSS DOMESTIC BATTERY</string>
  <string id="19613">I saw your husband beating you.</string>
  <string id="19614">This is none of your business, Hector, so please stay out of it. You know nothing, you won't understand, and I'm not going to tell you.</string>
  <string id="19615">And the main thing, Hector: just forget what you saw, and never spy on state officials again.</string>
  <string id="19616">But this is my duty.</string>
  <string id="19617">Please, don't argue. &lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#D53838FF&gt;I love my husband&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, he is an amazing man.</string>
  <string id="19618">That's all you need to know about our family.</string>
  <string id="19619">DISCUSS SAVING RELATIVES</string>
  <string id="19620">Your husband told me about his father and your job. Please, help me.</string>
  <string id="19621">So, you know, then? Yes, I helped my dear father-in-law to survive the Blissful Sleep.</string>
  <string id="19622">Yes, I work at the euthanasia center, and yes, I kill our citizens every day.</string>
  <string id="19623">This makes me feel like a murderer, Hector. &lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#D53838FF&gt;The guilt is unbearable&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, and I'm punishing myself by asking my husband to beat me.</string>
  <string id="19624">That's the only way I can cope.</string>
  <string id="19625">So, can you help me? Please, I don't want to die.</string>
  <string id="19626">Hector, but you have nothing to worry about, you don't even look 80. What are you talking about?</string>
  <string id="19627">That damn bureaucracy!</string>
  <string id="19628">They made a mistake, so now everyone thinks I'm 85! And I already got the order to complete all of my unfinished business and go to the Euthanasia Center!</string>
  <string id="19629">Hm. I see. I saw people way younger than 85 there… And had to put them all down.</string>
  <string id="19630">Please, Gertrude! I beg you. You're not a ruthless killer.</string>
  <string id="19631">CONVINCE (-2000 reputation points)</string>
  <string id="19632">This is a huge risk. If they find out, I'll be most likely executed for state treason.</string>
  <string id="19633">Then again, I deserve this. I could've refused to take the job…</string>
  <string id="19634">…</string>
  <string id="19635">I'll help you, Hector. You seem to be a nice guy, you managed to stay kind with the job like yours…</string>
  <string id="19636">Here's the plan. My husband and his squad will come for you and drag you out on the street, as a criminal. They'll hit you to make it look real.</string>
  <string id="19637">Once you're in the center, I'll give you sleeping aid; you'll wake up a day later, and will be taken out of the country. After that, you're on your own.</string>
  <string id="19638">I don't believe you, Hector. The Ministry of Information doesn't err.</string>
  <string id="19639">END CONVERSATION</string>
  <string id="19640">DISCUSS THE AGREEMENT</string>
  <string id="19641">Your life is hard, but you're a great person, Gertrude.</string>
  <string id="19642">You have a big heart.</string>
  <string id="19643">Okay, okay…</string>
  <string id="19644">We'll help you.</string>
  <string id="19645">I'll meet you at the center, and my husband will pick you up at the morgue and ship abroad. Make sure to have money on you.</string>
  <string id="19646">Morgue?</string>
  <string id="19647">I'll give you a shot of sleeping aid, you'll wake up in the morgue, and my husband will get you at night.</string>
  <string id="19648">You have to trust us, Hector.</string>
  <string id="19649">DISCUSS WEATHER</string>
  <string id="19650">How do you like our merciless summer?</string>
  <string id="19651">The parental advice of "dress in layers" works in any weather!</string>
  <string id="19652">I know, right! Ever since we're kids, we hear tons of wise advice, but don't see their value.</string>
  <string id="19653">Too often, wisdom of our parents is understood too late…</string>
  <string id="19654">And vice versa, we retain some of the other words, even though we would've been better off forgetting.</string>
  <string id="19655">When I was a kid, I loved singing. But mother told me it's not respectable to be a singer.</string>
  <string id="19656">So, I went to the med school. &lt;b&gt;&lt;color=#D53838FF&gt;I love music&lt;/color&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, but don't sing anymore.</string>
  <string id="19657">DISCUSS HEALTHCARE</string>
  <string id="19658">I've heard they started financing healthcare more.</string>
  <string id="19659">That's true, we finally have disposable gloves and needles. Alas, the needles become blunt too fast, and cause a lot of pain.</string>
  <string id="19660">DISCUSS MEDICAL SYMPOSIUM</string>
  <string id="19661">I've heard there is a conference of big shots in medicine…</string>
  <string id="19662">Though this year, some tricksters occupied one of the sections, registered by deceit and are doing crazy things.</string>
  <string id="19663">I laughed my head off after reading their theses.</string>
  <string id="19664">Let me think… What do you think about the report on "Using motherland soil to treat blood diseases"?</string>
  <string id="19665">Or this one, "Ten ways to use sagebrush for infant diseases". Then again, the official section has its awkward moments, too.</string>
  <string id="19666">I.e., "Treating respiratory diseases with lye soap". The speaker's wife is the soap factory director, as far as I know.</string>
  <string id="19667">That's impressive!</string>
  <string id="19668">ASK WHAT SHE WANTS</string>
  <string id="19669">What's up?</string>
  <string id="19670">My husband is dead!</string>
  <string id="19671">It's horrible, he is… squished!</string>
  <string id="19672">Something squished my husband!</string>
  <string id="19673">You need to lay down…</string>
  <string id="19674">Bed bugs! There are bed bugs in our apartment!</string>
  <string id="19675">SELL SPRAY (-250 reputation points)</string>
  <string id="19676">I have a great spray for that! It's only $500.</string>
  <string id="19677">Okay, I'll take it.</string>
  <string id="19678">You should do it for free, Hector!</string>
  <string id="19679">COMFORT</string>
  <string id="19680">No way! That's a clean house, I exterminate in all apartments annually!</string>
  <string id="19681">Exterminate?! Oh, you mean the bugs…</string>
  <string id="19682">I believe you, but I also believe my eyes, and they tell me our bed is swarming with bugs!</string>
  <string id="19683">Okay, Gertrude, I'll deal with it.</string>
  <string id="19690">TALK ABOUT THE BEDBUGS</string>
  <string id="19691">Can you exterminate them?</string>
  <string id="19701">Talk to Cristofer and discuss the details.</string>
  <string id="18682">Ministry of Information. Greetings, Hector. What is your concern?</string>
  <string id="18683">Hello. I need to find out who someone is. How do I go about doing that?</string>
  <string id="18684">Find an item with the person's DNA and then give to the courier.</string>
  <string id="18685">Request accepted. The courier will arrive today.</string>
  <string id="18686">Your citizenship level is too low. You need more reputation points.</string>
  <string id="18687">CALL BRUNO HEMPF (DISCUSS EUTHANASIA)</string>
  <string id="18688">Have you heard of the Blissful Sleep procedure? You know I'm not 85 years old! I don't want to die!</string>
  <string id="18689">Everybody wants to live in paradise but no one wants to die. That doesn't change anything, however.</string>
  <string id="18690">You're mistaken about not being 85. The Ministry of Congratulations doesn't err.</string>
  <string id="18691">If the registry says you're 85, you're 85.</string>
  <string id="18692">But I'm not even 65! Can't anyone at the Ministry fix the paper?</string>
  <string id="18693">You mean commit fraud? Medina, are you insane?</string>
  <string id="18694">Anyone trying to fix this so-called "error" will be branded a federal criminal and arrested immediately!</string>
  <string id="18695">Do you want someone to sacrifice their life to commit treason for you?</string>
  <string id="18696">Remember, once and for all: no Ministry of our Great State ever makes a mistake!</string>
  <string id="18697">Even thinking that way is a crime!</string>
  <string id="18698">CALL BRUNO HEMPF (DISCUSS ZLATA'S REAL PARENTAGE)</string>
  <string id="18699">Comrade Hempf, I have a personal request.</string>
  <string id="18700">Hector, you do realize making personal requests to a state official is considered an abuse of authority?</string>
  <string id="18701">There's no room for anything personal in our Great State. Everything is for the communal good.</string>
  <string id="18702">I'm sorry. I won't trouble you again.</string>
  <string id="18703">You give up too easily, Medina! The communal good consists of the happiness of every citizen!</string>
  <string id="18704">And I can tell you're not after personal gain. What is it?</string>
  <string id="18705">I need to know who Zlata Schimmer's real parents are. You see, she was adopted.</string>
  <string id="18706">Zlata was hit by a car recently and needs a bone marrow donor.</string>
  <string id="18707">She was adopted? Oh yes, I remember that very clearly. Ha ha ha...</string>
  <string id="18708">So?</string>
  <string id="18709">Information is expensive, Hector. I'll give you what you're seeking in exchange for something else.</string>
  <string id="18710">What do you want me to do?</string>
  <string id="18711">Not you. Maria Schimmer. I'd like her to do me a... uh... personal favor...</string>
  <string id="18712">Arrange a rendezvous and I'll bring you the information.</string>
  <string id="18713">What? I don't understand...</string>
  <string id="18714">Of course you do, Medina. You're a grown man. Tell Maria I'll be waiting for her in my apartment.</string>
  <string id="18715">If it makes her feel better, tell her I have champagne and fruit.</string>
  <string id="18716">But comrade Hempf... That's an egregious abuse of authority!</string>
  <string id="18717">Doesn't that go against the best interest of our citizens and state?</string>
  <string id="18718">Oh, Hector, I do not separate myself from our Great State.</string>
  <string id="18719">What's good for me is good for the people and vice versa. So enough chit-chat; get back to work!</string>
  <string id="18720">But she's married! How could I even bring that up?</string>
  <string id="18721">With your mouth, Hector. That's what people normally use to communicate.</string>
  <string id="18722">Her child's life is at stake; she'll do anything.</string>
  <string id="18723">And if she becomes stubborn, remind her that she got through it the last time, when she was adopting the girl.</string>
  <string id="18724">Remind Maria that I was the one who helped them get that child!</string>
  <string id="18725">To satisfy their selfish desire to propagate, I had to deprive another family of its happiness. My heart still bleeds when I think about that.</string>
  <string id="18726">Goodness! You gave them someone else's child to satisfy your lust?!</string>
  <string id="18727">I don't like your tone, Medina, or the way you're twisting the facts.</string>
  <string id="18728">I helped a childless couple have a kid, thereby creating a functional social unit. That's a fact!</string>
  <string id="18729">Is there any other way?</string>
  <string id="18730">Why am I wasting my time on you, Medina? Don't answer that question; it's rhetorical.</string>
  <string id="18731">There's another way. My nephew graduated from the cattle breeding institute recently. He needs a good job.</string>
  <string id="18732">Klaus works at the Ministry of Finance, but they're not hiring.</string>
  <string id="18733">So, encourage him to create a vacancy.</string>
  <string id="18734">How could he do that?</string>
  <string id="18735">What happened to your imagination, Hector? He could give up his job so my nephew could have it.</string>
  <string id="18736">So, Klaus quits and passes the torch to the younger generation.</string>
  <string id="18737">Then perhaps I could help them out...</string>
  <string id="18738">Is that all you can offer to the Schimmers?</string>
  <string id="18739">Well, they could give me money. We're always short on liquid funds at the Ministry.</string>
  <string id="18740">I'd need $150,000.</string>
  <string id="18741">Now stop getting on my nerves; I gave you three options!</string>
  <string id="18742">CHOOSE THE DATE WITH MARIA</string>
  <string id="18743">It sounds awful, but I'll try to tell Maria about your offer. After all, who am I to judge her?</string>
  <string id="18744">That's the right attitude. I must go now; I need to rest before her visit.</string>
  <string id="18745">CHOOSE THE JOB OPTION</string>
  <string id="18746">I'll tell Klaus he needs to quit his job. I don't know how they'll survive without his paycheck, but I suppose they have greater concerns.</string>
  <string id="18747">He'll easily find another job! I'll see to it; don't worry.</string>
  <string id="18748">CHOOSE THE MONEY OPTION</string>
  <string id="18749">I hope they can find that much money.</string>
  <string id="18750">Worry about yourself, Hector. Counting other people's money is for ministry officials, if you know what I mean.</string>
  <string id="18751">You haven't earned a promotion yet.</string>
  <string id="18752">CALL BRUNO HEMPF (TELL HIM MARIA AGREED)</string>
  <string id="18753">Bruno? I told Maria about your offer, and she agreed.</string>

  <string id="18755">Tell her I'll be waiting at the same place as last time.</string>
  <string id="18756">Comrade Hempf, what about the information I requested?</string>
  <string id="18757">What information?</string>
  <string id="18758">Don't play stupid! You know you promised to tell me who Zlata's real parents are!</string>
  <string id="18759">Lower your voice! You'll get the details tomorrow.</string>

  <string id="18764">I can see the Ministry giving me an Outstanding Service award!</string>
  <string id="18765">That's enough; stop bothering me.</string>
  <string id="18766">Lower your voice. You'll get the details tomorrow. I'm not in the mood to deal with that right now.</string>

  <string id="18771">I don't know... The Great Leader's birthday?</string>
  <string id="18772">Yes, of course! With that much money, we could truly celebrate in style!</string>
  <string id="18773">When will he give me the money?</string>
  <string id="18774">Tomorrow.</string>
  <string id="18775">Fine! What else do you want?</string>

  We are happy to announce you've been appointed the landlord of a Class D apartment block on Krushvice 6.

  You must go there immediately and begin working. We have given you and your family an apartment on the first floor.

  <string id="9110">Beholder</string>
  <string id="8925">It rained the day of Carl's funeral. When his cheap pinewood coffin was covered with soil, the bleak autumn sun peaked out from behind the blanket of gray clouds.</string>
  <string id="9051">A thin fog was settling over the cemetery.</string>
  <string id="9052">No one from Carl Stein's family was destined to live to the end of the year.</string>
  <string id="8926">The entire neighborhood came to see Carl dragged into the police car. His face was covered with blood, and his pants had a hole where his building keys had been, as the police had torn them out with the fabric.</string>
  <string id="9053">To the bitter end of his short life, Carl wondered what happened to his family.</string>
  <string id="8928">Press any key to continue</string>
  <string id="228">Anna has died.</string>
  <string id="229">Patrick has died.</string>
  <string id="230">Martha has died.</string>
  <string id="12278">Due to the efforts of hundreds and thousands people like Carl Stein, the state machine kept growing and growing. The New Tomorrow movement was destroyed, and all of its members arrested.</string>
  <string id="13466">Some of them died in the mines; the others perished while being punished or were executed. Their weak voices were drowned by a cacophony of mottos and slogans.</string>
  <string id="13467">Dissidence was exterminated without mercy, and the citizenry was of a single mind: no doubts, no reluctance, no unnecessary questions. Isn't that happiness?</string>
  <string id="12279">The spark of the New Tomorrow movement gradually fanned the flames of a revolution, and the Wise Leader's tyranny was overthrown. It took years to dispose of the enormous bureaucratic machine, but in time, the people could finally sleep peacefully at night.</string>
  <string id="13468">Freedom of Speech and the Right to Privacy were the first entitlements the new democratic government restored, and every official that misused his or her position was arrested and locked up in the jail cells previously occupied by political prisoners.</string>
  <string id="13469">Although the revolution took many honest lives as well, one can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs, right?</string>
  <string id="12280">The war raged on for decades, grinding the people into a homogenous, meaty pulp.</string>
  <string id="13470">Able-bodied youth died by the thousands every day in the pointless massacre.</string>
  <string id="13471">And all technological, medical, and agricultural progress was sacrificed in the name of violence.</string>
  <string id="12281">Unexpectedly, each party having an ultima ratio turned the tables. Both sides were afraid to use it.</string>
  <string id="13472">But the fear of the enemy using the 'nuclear club' was even stronger. That lead to the cooldown of military operations; several decades later, a reluctant peace was made.</string>
  <string id="13473">Though not at once, both countries managed the economical conversion. But the search for external enemies never seized completely...</string>
  <string id="12282">The rumors of gas turning people into zombie patriots and of weapons of mass destruction reached the frontline. Overcome with fear, officers from both sides plotted together and started a coup.</string>
  <string id="13474">But after they arrested the current governments and announced the end of the war, they lost control of their respective countries. Mass desertions from both armies paved the way for chaos, and marauders and bandits seized the arsenals of both nations and took control.</string>
  <string id="13475">Unfortunately, the constantly changing leadership of both countries made it impossible to turn either economy around. Unemployment, overpopulation, and hunger are still at epidemic levels.</string>
  <string id="12283">Carl stayed in his first story apartment. Eventually, he became rich and could buy anything he wanted. But no matter how hard Carl tried to lie to himself, the loss of his family ruined him.</string>
  <string id="13476">He missed Anna's nagging, Patrick's juvenile maximalism, and Martha's happy laughter.</string>
  <string id="13477">The walls of Carl's apartment caved in on him, trapping him under the monstrous weight of his memories and guilt, and he remained depressed and suicidal until the end of his days.</string>
  <string id="12284">Carl and his wife and daughter stayed in their first story apartment, and Anna found a job.</string>
  <string id="13478">Even though Martha's poor health remained a source of stress for her parents, they had enough to pay for her treatment, and her happy laughter often brightened their moods.</string>
  <string id="13479">It's a shame things didn't turn out differently for Patrick, though. His family missed his juvenile maximalism and drive to succeed.</string>
  <string id="12285">Carl and his wife stayed in their first story apartment, and Anna found a job. In time, they became rich and could buy anything they wanted.</string>
  <string id="13480">Martha's death hit them hard, though, and Patrick's fate ruined what little was left of their former happiness.</string>
  <string id="13481">The silently agreed to not have any more children, considering this cruel world to be an improper place for kids.</string>
  <string id="12286">Carl and his daughter stayed in their first story apartment. Although Martha was his only joy, she helped him survive his wife's death.</string>
  <string id="13482">She supported and loved her father, and he returned her familial affection.</string>
  <string id="13483">But the fate of Anna and Patrick forever cast a shadow of quiet sadness over their house.</string>
  <string id="12287">The family's attempt to emigrate failed. Carl wasn't simply arrested; he was executed on the spot as a traitor and a state criminal.</string>
  <string id="13484">His family's fate was all over the mass media, and their deaths served as a dire warning to anyone considering escape.</string>
  <string id="13485">At long last, the iron curtain fell.</string>
  <string id="12288">Carl and his family made it across the border, where they found friendly smiles, clean streets, and beautiful blue skies. As soon as they stopped worrying for their lives, they realized living without constant supervision was not only possible, it was liberating!</string>
  <string id="13486">Patrick graduated from the local college and became a successful architect, building gorgeous and comfortable houses. (He could never bring himself to design an apartment building.) Martha's health improved considerably in the warm climate, and her charming smile left no one untouched.</string>
  <string id="13487">Eventually, the family saved up enough to open a small café, which Anna managed. Carl's experience in cataloguing data and observing others came in handy, too.

However, he is also terribly unhappy.</string>
  <string id="13497">The losses he suffered filled his life with debilitating pain, and Patrick, who blamed Carl for Anna's and Martha's deaths, never spoke to his father again.</string>
  <string id="12294">The side effects of the experimental sleep suppressant given to Carl during the medical check-up were catastrophic, and in time, he slipped into a coma.</string>
  <string id="13498">His slumbering mind fruitlessly tried to escape the imaginary world, where Carl was charged with a horribly dull task: searching for the center of the universe.</string>
  <string id="13499">He found it many times, but it always contained nothing. NOTHING, CARL!</string>
  <string id="12295">Carl and his family stayed in their first story apartment, and Anna found a job. Even though Martha's poor health remained a source of stress for her parents, they had enough to pay for her treatment, and her happy laughter often brightened their moods.</string>
  <string id="13500">However, Patrick's unfriendly disposition eventually become unbearable, and his parents sighed with relief when he signed up for the frontline.</string>

  <string id="13505">But the fate of Anna and Patrick forever cast a shadow of quiet sadness over their house.</string>
  <string id="12298">Carl's remarkable determination and loyalty to his job was well rewarded. The state had finally found its ideal employee: one with no doubt, remorse, or attachments!</string>
  <string id="13506">Carl was chosen to become the Golden Standard of Citizenship in a new cloning experiment, and before long, thousands of duplicate Carls started their jobs.</string>
  <string id="13507">The original Carl died in the process, but no one cried for him because there was no place for regret in the Wonderful Future of the Great State. Only Happiness, always Hardcore!</string>
  <string id="12300">A massive explosion destroyed the whole apartment block. Old beams couldn't hold it, and the roof collapsed, burying every tenant in ruins.</string>
  <string id="13508">The fire erupted and was spread all over the neighborhood by severe winds. Fire killed everyone, state criminals and honest citizens alike. In two hours, Krushvice Street was gone.</string>
  <string id="13509">The sad fate of Carl and his family was only briefly mentioned in the newspaper obituary, which read, "Died of natural cause..."</string>

  <string id="12277">Hello, little one! Today, we will tell you a wise tale of three piglets. Once upon a time, there was a huge apartment complex managed by the Grey Wolf. Three piglets, all of whom were brothers, lived there. Their names were Nih-Nih, Nah-Nah, and Nuh-Nuh. Nih-Nih was very poor: he slept on a straw mattress and used a rag nailed to the wall instead of a door. This little piglet had a dairy in which he recorded all of his troubles with the landlord. He was sure his home was his fortress, and believed nobody would ever find his book. Nah-Nah had more than his brother. He had a real bed, and his door was made of plywood and had a latch. At night, Nah-Nah liked to experiment with his radio. In time, he was able to tune into a foreign radio station prohibited by the Grey Wolf. Nuh-Nuh, the oldest, loved his life. He had a king-size bed and a sturdy oak door with a huge iron lock. He worked in the Ministry of Groceries, and lived high on the hog, selling stolen food to his brothers. Then came the day when the Grey Wolf ran out of patience. He pulled aside the little brother's rag, knocked out the middle one's plywood door, and unlocked the oldest one's oak door. Then he took the fat, lazy piglets to the factory to be turned into delicious sausages. He then gave the links to the other tenants – the very ones who had diligently watched and reported the activities of the piglets to the Grey Wolf. All this happened because the piglets forgot who gave them everything they had. So remember, little one, it doesn't matter how you live: the landlord sees it all! Just be happy you don't get sausages for dinner too often; in means we don't have many traitors among us!</string>

Why pay pensions to those who are not working and serving our Great Motherland? We are proud to open the innovative International Euthanasia Center! All citizens aged 85 and older are mandated to report to the center within two weeks and undergo the Blissful Sleep procedure! Be responsible, comrade! You lived your life; let others have a go at theirs!

The Ministry of Order reminds its citizens that they are required to report anyone who is dodging his or her civic duty.</string>
  <string id="14742">Happy 85th birthday!</string>
  <string id="14743">Ministry of Congratulations</string>
  <string id="14752">Hector Medina's efforts to keep his building in order were not enough. As he was dragged out of his apartment, beaten and defeated, Hector realized nobody in the Ministry had ever expected him to succeed.</string>
  <string id="14753">As soon as Hector received that damned card, they chose his successor.</string>
  <string id="14754">Hector was consigned to spend several days in a cold prison cell, waiting to be murdered during what the Ministry was cowardly calling the Blissful Sleep procedure.</string>
  <string id="14755">Even though Hector had given up and was ready to undergo euthanasia voluntarily, nobody appreciated his obedience. Instead, the policemen who came to fetch him beat him and threw him in the truck.</string>
  <string id="14756">They weren't mean people; they had just forgotten things could be done differently. In the machinery of a big state, every little cog and gear is simply doing its job.</string>
  <string id="14757">Hector's last moments were filled with pain from his bruises, the cold prick of a needle and a surge of sleepiness. He had no energy left to think of the glorious past. The only thing he remembered was that a Great State led by a Wise Leader does not err.</string>
  <string id="14758">Money can open many doors when you're young. But the older you get, the more you realize some doors are best left unopened, and it's a good idea to always have an escape plan.</string>
  <string id="14759">Hector had to give everything he had to the boss to avoid death.</string>
  <string id="14760">The maddeningly monotonous work in the archive, the piles of dusty papers and an incurable invisibility became Hector's new norm. He wrote hundreds of letters to his son but never mailed any of them.</string>
  <string id="14761">Hector Medina was dead to the outer world. As for himself, he kept wondering until he breathed his dying breath if he'd ever lived at all.</string>
  <string id="14762">Harsh times demand harsh measures. But trying to strike a deal with his morals was a real struggle for Hector.</string>
  <string id="14763">Infuriated by the attempt at blackmail, the policeman did what Hector had told him to do, but in his own manner. Hector survived, but was left completely broken.</string>
  <string id="14764">Hector had no ID or other papers, and was forced to hide in the slums to avoid the government officials who were looking for him. As his stomach growled from hunger and he spent his days and nights shivering in the cold, Hector came to think the Blissful Sleep procedure wouldn't have been such a bad choice. The only thing that kept him going was his dream of seeing his son again. Too bad it never came true.</string>
  <string id="14765">When people whose souls seem to have been crushed into oblivion turn out to be capable of compassion, the beauty of their actions is indescribable.</string>
  <string id="14766">To thank Hector for helping their family, the policeman and his wife managed to stage Hector's death in the Euthanasia Center and ship him abroad.</string>
  <string id="14767">Once Hector had left his chilly, humid basement behind and was soaking up warm sunlight, and feeling soft sand beneath his feet, and letting cool, refreshing seawater wash over his old bones, his rheumatism was cured.</string>
  <string id="14768">Even though Hector had to work long after he should have retired, he never complained. He had time to write to his son, and sometimes even heard back from him.</string>
  <string id="14769">When people whose souls seem to have been crushed into oblivion turn out to be capable of compassion, the beauty of their actions is indescribable.</string>
  <string id="14770">To thank Hector for helping their family, the policeman and his wife managed to stage Hector's death in the Euthanasia Center and ship him abroad.</string>
  <string id="14771">Once Hector had left his chilly, humid basement behind and was soaking up warm sunlight, and feeling soft sand beneath his feet, and letting cool seawater wash over his old bones, his rheumatism was cured. He eventually made enough money to buy every necessity. But this triumph paled in comparison to when he finally convinced his son to move in with him.</string>
  <string id="14772">The only thing Hector tried to avoid thinking about was how many people he'd deprived of happiness, and how many lives he'd crushed on his path to prosperity.</string>

  <string id="16388">The grand opening of the National Euthanasia Center was held yesterday afternoon. The senior minister of the Ministry of Care, Andre Borlan, gave a patriotic speech about the duty of every citizen of this great country.

Henry Orlowski became the first visitor to the center! We congratulate the honored worker of the Post Office and wish him eternal peace.

From this day forward, every citizen must go to the center within two weeks of turning 85-years-old to undergo the Blissful Sleep procedure.

This is not punishment but a reward to true patriots for their lifetime of service!

The Euthanasia Center is open to the public for tours Tuesdays from 6-7 p.m.</string>
  <string id="18654">This day marks the beginning of the end for our country.

What is the life of an ordinary citizen like? He works from dawn to dusk to provide for his family. Dragging himself along the dirty streets at night after a long and arduous shift, he dreams of the day he can retire and trade his exhausting labors for some well-deserved rest and relaxation.

Our people are tired and have no strength for the struggle of life. They have been weary since high school, when they were forced to study volume after volume of meaningless memoirs written by our so-called Great Leader!

Our citizens are deprived of their last hope: peaceful twilight years! What's next? Compulsory reproduction in order to build more industrial premises and excavate more mines?

People, either wake up from your slumber or go up in smoke!</string>

We also want to inform you that the leader of the clandestine organization responsible for printing anti-government leaflets has been terminated.</string>
  <string id="18657">Our comrade has died but his work lives on! We will continue to be the voice of truth in a nation built on lies!

The surgical skills of Dr. Alloisius Shpak delight us to no end. At the same time, our hearts are pierced with grief because of the thousands of ordinary people who will die without having received an allocation for surgery.

Minister should have undergone the Blissful Sleep procedure instead!</string>

The best of the best will gather in Helmer this month to discuss pressing medical issues. Reports that will be presented include "Dealing with complaints in an error-free profession," "Taking the life of a patient for the sake of science" and "Organ transplants without the consent of the donor."

Roundtable discussions will also be held on the following topics: "Health and nutrition: developing a food plan in times of war," "The impact of loud sounds on the human body and mind" and "Anesthesia: a necessity or a lack of willpower?"

The findings will be published in the Medical News Journal's annual report.</string>
  <string id="18660">Do we need to say anything more about the state of health care in our country? As evidenced by doctors discussing the necessity of anesthesia during surgery, there's a clear lack of concern for patients!

Deprived of their rights and voices, they go from being full-fledged citizens to test subjects at the whim of the Ministry. And these people pay taxes!</string>
  <string id="18661">The sacred blood of the people!</string>
  <string id="18662">Scientists from the Ministry of the Protection of the Future have made a startling breakthrough. They have tied a person's degree of patriotism to the composition of his or her blood and DNA!

A glorious future awaits us, comrades - a future without traitors, hatred, or pain!

We are literally going to root out the enemies of this nation at a genetic level!

In the near future, mandatory blood collection stations will be installed on the city streets. Testing will be obligatory!</string>
  <string id="18663">Revelation!

Our Wise Leader is an ancient vampire. That is the only explanation for the terrible news the Ministry announced today!

A genetic blood purge of the population is coming!

Beware of infections while donating blood!

Better yet, run!</string>
  <string id="18664">Public notices</string>
  <string id="18665">The Lost and Found Office is selling items no one has claimed for more than five years. The inventory currently includes 57 black umbrellas, 16 bags of spoiled food and more. Additional information is available at Storehouse 8.

The Bumpy Road Theater Troupe is coming to the city to perform its popular "Pirates of the Ob Sea" show. The troupe will cast a local actor in the role of a pirate. Auditions are being held now.

The quarterly Labor and Defense awards are over! The Ministry issued 1,783 certificates of appreciation and six vouchers for vacation centers!</string>
  <string id="18666">Only we will reveal the terrible consequences of the 50 propaganda machines the ministry recently deployed. The loud sounds have cracked the windows of countless apartment buildings and confidential sources tell us more than 200 people have been hospitalized as a result of related injuries! All this is in addition to the many people who have suffered serious mental harm!</string>
  <string id="18667">Happy childhood</string>
  <string id="18668">The Ministry of Upbringing is considering removing children from unreliable families to ensure they receive a proper patriotic upbringing. These youth will be sent to education camps.

At the moment, there are five options: military, science, medical, labor and the arts. From the youngest age, our children will be raised to have traditional values and learn to work for their country and become good citizens!</string>
  <string id="18669">People have been debating about how to bring up children since the dawn of time. But history teaches us that youth should be raised in a loving and nurturing environment and learn to work and be responsible for themselves. In other words, they need to be raised in the real world, not in a lab!

Comrades: Let's not allow our children to be taken from their families and sent to patriot factories!</string>
  <string id="18670">Culture news</string>
  <string id="18671">The opening night of "Pirates of the Ob Sea" was a resounding success! The actors demonstrated the value of making an honest living instead of trying to get rich through deceit.
Murray Gibbs debuted as the main pirate. His parrot, startled by the thunderous applause, pecked out his eye, but comrade Gibbs remained cool, calm and collected, so he was awarded a certificate of bravery.</string>
  <string id="18672">We highly recommend you see the show. Given what the Ministry officials who have seen it have posted, none of them are smart enough to figure out what's going on.
Let's put it the way a modern author, whose name is prohibited by law, did: 'Some states are worse than a bunch of drunk pirates who fire a cannon into their own hold to get rid of rats!'</string>
  <string id="18673">The opening night of "Pirates of the Ob" was a resounding success! The actors demonstrated the value of making an honest living instead of trying to get rich through deceit.

  <string id="19333">Death by gloves</string>
  <string id="19334">Killer claims seventh victim!

Geneve Jasmin, the prima ballerina of the Theatre of the Wise Leader, was found dead in Hellmer last night. Geneve was a rising star on the cusp of touring the capital.

Police are withholding information on what they think the white gloves, found on every victim, signify.
The maniac's first victim was Mary Pickfold. The singer was reported missing in April 1979.</string>
  <string id="19335">How strange that a state swarming with police is unable to catch a maniac over the course of several years. Official sources put the number of victims at seven, but that's a lie! Over 20 women have been murdered. Although the means of their demise have varied, they were all wearing white gloves. The police are withholding facts to avoid a panic.

We will continue to ask why the maniac hasn't been caught. Is he a ministry employee? Or is he simply smart enough to have avoided arrest for over five years?</string>
  <string id="19336">Scientific news</string>
  <string id="19337">A secret attempt by the Ministry of Science to create the first teleporter ended in disaster. Only one security officer survived. He seems to have been traumatized, as he keeps babbling about demons pouring through a portal to hell and asking where his 'BFG' is. Johanne Bessler, lead engineer of the project, is under arrest.</string>
  <string id="19338">I wish our scientists would invent a quick and easy way to grow food! The people are starving! Good groceries are expensive and hard to find, even when someone has money!</string>
  <string id="19339">An explosion at Military Base 7890P was felt several miles away from the epicenter of the blast. During a test of SHAGOHOD, the new mech that was supposed to turn the tables of war, a spy snuck in, neutralized security and blew up the machine. Johanne Bessler, lead engineer, was arrested for failing to complete the project. (The blueprints indicated the mech was supposed to be armored, which would have protected it.)</string>
  <string id="19340">Tests of a portable phone were completed yesterday. Our officials can now make calls from their cars and issue even more brilliant edicts! The Ministry of Science has promoted the lead engineer on the project, Johanne Bessler, to lead inventor!</string>
  <string id="19341">We are winning!</string>
  <string id="19342">Our beloved country is winning the war with the damned capitalists with whom we share a map! After briefly falling back, our soldiers have surged forward and are crushing the enemy! Soon, we will prevail, and our Great Leader will rule the world!

&lt;b&gt;Accidents&lt;/b&gt;
Zlata Schimmer, who survived an extremely complicated surgery carried out by a genius surgeon, Alloisius Shpak, has been kidnapped from the hospital! All of the security personnel are under arrest and an investigation is underway.</string>
  <string id="19343">While the state-run newspapers waste ink raving about our Great Leader's incredible triumphs, we recommend the minsters consider the veterans of those wars. They live in barracks for years while waiting for an apartment, and when one finally becomes available, it's a class D living space at best. What's more, the managers of those buildings could evict them at any time for the slightest violation - or on a whim!
Our veterans receive an inadequate pension, no respect, and no provisions! It seems the lucky ones died in battle!</string>
  <string id="19400">The test run of a new piece of medical equiment - the ClearEye Opti - ended in disaster. Ten people suffocated, five people are suffering from psychosis due to an overdose of an experimental sedative the ClearEye administered, and other volunteers were injured in various ways. Over 40 people couldn't take off the wetsuit. Johanne Bessler, the lead engineer on the project, is in custody.</string>
  <string id="19401">I don't know if you're getting my letters because there's no mail here. In fact, there's nothing here at all. The thought of traveling north on the railroad is no longer appealing. Nobody lives here; I'm in the middle of nowhere.
If I'm remembering correctly, it's your birthday. Happy 65th, father! I'm sorry I was rude to you the last time we saw each other.</string>
  <string id="19402">I can't provide you with a return address because there's nothing but open space for as far as the eye can see.</string>
  <string id="19403">We've heard about the Blissful Sleep, father. I'm speechless. I've learned to value life since coming here and living in these wretched conditions. A hermit lives near our camp. He's about 90. He treated me with herbs when I had pneumonia. I believe he saved my life. He didn't ask me to pay him, though, which is fortunate because I had nothing to give him.</string>
  <string id="19404">I'm glad you're not wrapped up in this madness.</string>
  <string id="19405">I saw the aurora borealis, father! They were more beautiful than I could describe. They struck quite a contrast to the emaciated, desperate people around me. I don't know if we're the builders of the future or mere slaves. We have no doctors, no cooks, and no hope; our world consists of an endless, stinging wind and a parade of tumbleweeds.</string>
  <string id="19406">I don't even want to think about the weather getting cold. I don't know if I'll be able to survive this winter.</string>
  <string id="19407">Hector, you have incredible foresight! I've already received my first returns and want to thank you. Sincerely, Johanne Bessler</string>
  <string id="17124">I don't want to die</string>
